From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences,David Cahan,History,,3,"During the nineteenth century, much of the modern scientific enterprise took shape: scientific disciplines were formed, institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred. In this book, eleven leading historians of science assess what their field has taught us about this exciting time and identify issues that remain unexamined or require reconsideration. They treat both scientific disciplines—biology, physics, chemistry, the earth sciences, mathematics, and the social sciences—in their specific intellectual and sociocultural contexts as well as the broader topics of science and medicine; science and religion; scientific institutions and communities; and science, technology, and industry. Providing a much-needed overview and analysis of a rapidly expanding field, From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences will be essential for historians of science, but also of great interest to scholars of all aspects of nineteenth-century life and culture.

A Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities,Anthony Kaldellis,History,8.22 EUR,,"Weird, decadent, degenerate, racially mixed, superstitious, theocratic, effeminate, and even hyper-literate, Byzantium has long been regarded by many as one big curiosity. According to Voltaire, it represented ""a worthless collection of miracles, a disgrace for the human mind""; for Hegel, it was ""a disgusting picture of imbecility."" A Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities will churn up these old prejudices, while also stimulating a deeper interest among readers in one of history's most interesting civilizations. Many of the zanier tales and trivia that are collected here revolve around the political and religious life of Byzantium. Thus, stories of saints, relics, and their miracles-from the hilarious to the revolting-abound. Byzantine bureaucracy (whence the adjective ""Byzantine""), court scandals, and elaborate penal code are world famous. And what would Byzantium be without its eunuchs, whose ambiguous gender produced odd and risible outcomes in different contexts? The book also contains sections on daily life that are equally eye-opening, including food (from aphrodisiacs to fermented fish sauce), games such as polo and acrobatics, and obnoxious views of foreigners and others (e.g., Germans, Catholics, Arabs, dwarves). But lest we overlook Byzantium's more honorable contributions to civilization, also included are some of the marvels of Byzantine science and technology, from the military (flamethrowers and hand grenades) to the theatrical (""elevator"" thrones, roaring mechanical lions) and medical (catheters and cures, some bizarre). This vast assortment of historical anomaly and absurdity sheds vital light on one of history's most obscure and orthodox empires.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXQzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

My Desire for History,Allan Bérubé,Social Science,,,"This anthology pays tribute to Allan Berube (1946-2007), a self-taught historian and MacArthur Fellow who was a pioneer in the study of lesbian and gay history in the United States. Best known for his Lambda Literary Award-winning book Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II (1990), Berube also wrote extensively on the history of sexual politics in San Francisco and on the relationship between sexuality, class, and race. John D'Emilio and Estelle Freedman, who were close colleagues and friends of Berube, have selected sixteen of his most important essays, including hard-to-access articles and unpublished writing. The book provides a retrospective on Berube's life and work while it documents the emergence of a grassroots lesbian and gay community history movement in the 1970s and 1980s. Taken together, the essays attest to the power of history to mobilize individuals and communities to create social change.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8mJN7pcpERAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Teaching of History in Elementary and Secondary Schools (Classic Reprint),Henry Johnson,Education,,,"Excerpt from Teaching of History in Elementary and Secondary Schools IN beginning his illuminating treatment of the Holy Roman Empire, Lord Bryce wrote: In history there is nothing isolated, and just as to explain a modern act of Parliament, or a modern conveyance of lands, we must go back to the feudal customs of the thirteenth century, so among the institutions of the Middle Ages there is scarcely one which can be understood until it is traced up either to classical or to primitive Teutonic antiquity.

"Archive, Slow Ideology and Egodocuments as Microhistorical Autobiography",Sigurður Gylfi Magnússon,History,29.95 EUR,,"This book aims to demonstrate how scholars in recent times have been utilizing egodocuments from various angles and providing an opening for the multivocality of the sources to be fully appreciated. The first part of the book is concerned with the significance of egodocuments, both for the individual him/herself who creates such documents, and also for the other, who receives them. The author approaches the subject on the basis of his own personal experience, and goes on to discuss the importance of such documents for the academic world, emphasizing more general questions and issues within the fields of historiography, philosophy of history, microhistory, and memory studies. The second part of the book is based upon a photographic collection – an archive – that belonged to the author’s grandfather, who over decades accumulated photographs of vagabonds and outsiders. This part seeks to explore what kind of knowledge can be applied when a single source – an archive, document, letter, illustration, etc. – is examined, and whether the knowledge derived may not be quite as good in its own context as in the broader perspective.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3l5CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
A History of Energy Flows,Anthony N. Penna,Nature,56.7 EUR,,"This book presents a global and historical perspective of energy flows during the last millennium. The search for sustainable energy is a key issue dominating today’s energy regime. This book details the historical evolution of energy, following the overlapping and slow flowing transitions from one regime to another. In doing so it seeks to provide insight into future energy transitions and the means of utilizing sustainable energy sources to reduce humanity’s fossil fuel footprint. The book begins with an examination of the earliest and most basic forms of energy use, namely, that of humans metabolizing food in order to work, with the first transition following the domestication and breeding of horses and other animals. The book also examines energy sources key to development during the industrialization and mechanization, such as wood and coal, as well as more recent sources, such as crude oil and nuclear energy. The book then assesses energy flows that are at the forefront of sustainability, by examining green sources, such as solar, wind power and hydropower. While it is easy to see energy flows in terms of “revolutions,” transitions have taken centuries to evolve, and transitions are never fully global, as, for example, wood remains the primary fuel source for cooking in much of the developing world. This book not only demonstrates the longevity of energy transitions but also discusses the possibility for reducing transition times when technological developments provide inexpensive and safe energy sources that can reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of energy transitions, sustainable energy and environmental and energy history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gMyxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Origins of Nationalism,Caspar Hirschi,HISTORY,,,"""In this wide-ranging work, Caspar Hirschi offers new perspectives on the origins of nationalism and the formation of European nations. Based on extensive study of written and visual sources dating from the ancient to the early modern period, the author re-integrates the history of pre-modern Europe into the study of nationalism, describing it as an unintended and unavoidable consequence of the legacy of Roman imperialism in the Middle Ages. Hirschi identifies the earliest nationalists among Renaissance humanists, exploring their public roles and ambitions to offer new insight into the history of political scholarship in Europe and arguing that their adoption of ancient role models produced massive contradictions between their self-image and political function. This book demonstrates that only through understanding the development of the politics, scholarship and art of pre-modern Europe can we fully grasp the global power of nationalism in a modern political context""--",

A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty. By: Washington Irving and By: Diedrich Knickerbocker,"Washington Irving, Diedrich Knickerbocker",,,,"Diedrich Knickerbocker, persona invented by American writer Washington Irving to narrate the burlesque A History of New York (1809). An eccentric 25-year-old scholar, Knickerbocker relates this comic history of Dutch settlers in the American colony of New Amsterdam, satirizing Dutch-American mannerisms and retelling Dutch legends. Knickerbocker also narrates Irving's story Rip Van Winkle. The word Knickerbocker became synonymous with Dutch Americans in New York state and, later, with all residents of the state. The word also came to describe the knee breeches that characters wore in the original illustrated text of A History of New York............ Washington Irving (April 3, 1783 - November 28, 1859) was an American short story writer, essayist, biographer, historian, and diplomat of the early 19th century. He is best known for his short stories ""Rip Van Winkle"" (1819) and ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" (1820), both of which appear in his collection, The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. His historical works include biographies of Oliver Goldsmith, Muhammad, and George Washington, as well as several histories of 15th-century Spain dealing with subjects such as Alhambra, Christopher Columbus, and the Moors. Irving served as the U.S. ambassador to Spain from 1842 to 1846. He made his literary debut in 1802 with a series of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. After moving to England for the family business in 1815, he achieved international fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., serialized from 1819-20. He continued to publish regularly-and almost always successfully-throughout his life, and just eight months before his death (at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York), completed a five-volume biography of George Washington. Irving, along with James Fenimore Cooper, was among the first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and Irving encouraged American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. Irving was also admired by some European writers, including Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Charles Dickens, Francis Jeffrey, and Walter Scott. Also, as the United States' first internationally best-selling author, Irving advocated for writing as a legitimate profession and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement. Washington Irving's parents were William Irving, Sr., originally of Quholm, Shapinsay, Orkney, Scotland, and Sarah (nee Sanders), both Scottish-English immigrants. They married in 1761 while William was serving as a petty officer in the British Navy. They had eleven children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Their first two sons, each named William, died in infancy, as did their fourth child, John. Their surviving children were: William, Jr. (1766), Ann (1770), Peter (1771), Catherine (1774), Ebenezer (1776), John Treat (1778), Sarah (1780), and Washington.The Irving family settled in Manhattan, New York and was part of the city's small, vibrant merchant class when Washington Irving was born on April 3, 1783, the same week New York City residents learned of the British ceasefire that ended the American Revolution; Irving's mother named him after the hero of the revolution, George Washington.At age 6, with the help of a nanny, Irving met his namesake, who was then living in New York after his inauguration as President of the United States, in 1789. The president blessed young Irving, an encounter Irving later commemorated in a small watercolor painting, which continues to hang in his home.The Irvings lived at 131 William Street at the time of Washington Irving's birth. The family later moved across the street to 128 William St. Several of Washington Irving's older brothers became active New York merchants, and they encouraged their younger brother's literary aspirations....",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yo3YswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Settler Economies in World History,,Business & Economics,,,"Settler colonialism was a major aspect of the imperial age that began in the sixteenth century and has encompassed the whole world unto the present. Modern settler societies have together constituted one of the major routes to economic development from their foundation in resource abundance and labour scarcity. This book is a major and wide-ranging comparative historical enquiry into the experiences of the settler world. The roles of indigenous dispossession, large-scale immigrant labour, land abundance, trade, capital, and the settler institutions, are central to this economic formation and its history. The chapters examine those economies that emerged as genuine colonial hybrids out of their differing neo-European backgrounds, with distinctive post-independence structures and an institutional persistence into the present as independent states.

"A History of International Monetary Diplomacy, 1867 to the Present",Giulio M. Gallarotti,Business & Economics,51.35 EUR,,"This book is about how the rise of democracy has transformed economics over the past 150 years. As voting was expanded to the masses in the late 19th century, political leaders faced emergent pressures to deliver prosperity to their newly enfranchised populations. This led to the rise of the guardian state: a state whose prime directive was to protect economic growth and employment. Domestic economic goals now became sacrosanct, and if that meant a failure on the international stage to construct solutions to problems in monetary relations, so be it. The book traces the history of international monetary diplomacy during this long period to show how the guardian state has manifested itself, and how it has shaped the course of international monetary relations. Each of the most important international monetary conferences in history is scrutinized with respect to how nations sought to protect the prosperity within their national economies. The historical narratives give a bird’s-eye view into how domestic political priorities have intruded on and shaped economic relations among nations. The book clearly demonstrates the advantages of an interdisciplinary understanding of how politics shapes economics. It will be invaluable reading for scholars and students of international economics, politics and economic history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5gwxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

"Theatre History Studies 2014, Vol. 33",Elizabeth Reitz Mullenix,Performing Arts,,,"Volume 33 of Theatre History Studies explores war. War is a paradox—horrifying and compelling, galvanizing and devastating, a phenomenon that separates and decimates while at the same time creating and strengthening national identity and community bonds. War is the stuff of great drama. War and theatre is a subject of increasing popularity among scholars of theatre. The essays in this special edition of Theatre History Studies brings together a unique collection of work by thirteen innovative scholars whose work explores such topics as theatre performances during war times, theatre written and performed to resist war, and theatre that fosters and promotes war. The contributors to this volume write poignantly about nationhood and about how war—through both propaganda and protest—defines a people. The contributors also delve into numerous fascinating themes that transcend time, peoples, nations, and particular conflicts: the foundations of nationalism and the concepts of occupied and occupier, nostalgia and utopia, and patriotism and revolution. These essays survey a march of civil and international wars spanning three centuries. Arranged chronologically, they invite comparisons between themes and trace the development of the major themes of war. Ideas manifest in the theatre of one period recall ideologies and propaganda of the past, reflect those of the present, and anticipate wars to come.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aSL7kHUhCHwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Report of the Inception Workshop of the FAO Extrabudgetary Programme on Fisheries and Aquaculture for Poverty Alleviation and Food Security,,Technology & Engineering,,,"This Workshop was held to generate inputs and guidance to the contents and process of developing an assistance programme for fisheries and aquaculture. The programme's overall goal is to ensure that responsible and sustainable use of fisheries and aquaculture resources make an appreciable contribution to human well-being, food security and poverty alleviation. The workshop stressed the need to include fisheries and aquaculture, especially the small-scale subsectors, into poverty alleviation, food security and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes. These should be informed by a human rights approach to development. The challenges to advance the poverty alleviation and food security agendas are considerable. Concerted efforts and partnerships at different levels and scales are needed and interventions should be firmly anchored in the regional, national and local context. It is vital to build up national and local ownership in accordance with the Paris Declaration and this should be a key requirement for the inception phase and beyond.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B5WWo5tAmIoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
"Risk-Return Analysis, Volume 2: The Theory and Practice of Rational Investing",Harry M. Markowitz,Business & Economics,59.66 EUR,,"The Nobel Prize-winning Father of Modern Portfolio Theory returns with new insights on his classic work to help you build a lasting portfolio today Contemporary investing as we know it would not exist without these two words: “Portfolio selection.” Though it may not seem revolutionary today, the concept of examining and purchasing many diverse stocks—creating a portfolio—changed the face of finance when Harry M. Markowitz devised the idea in 1952. In the past six decades, Markowitz has risen to international acclaim as the father of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), with his evaluation of the impact of asset risk, diversification, and correlation in the risk-return tradeoff. In defending the idea that portfolio risk was essential to strategic asset growth, he showed the world how to invest for the long-run in the face of any economy. In Risk Return Analysis, this groundbreaking four-book series, the legendary economist and Nobel Laureate returns to revisit his masterpiece theory, discuss its developments, and prove its vitality in the ever-changing global economy. Volume 2 picks up where the first volume left off, with Markowitz’s personal reflections and current strategies. In this volume, Markowitz focuses on the relationship between single-period choices—now—and longer run goals. He discusses dynamic systems and models, the asset allocation “glide-path,” inter-generational investment needs, and financial decision support systems. Written with both the academic and the practitioner in mind, this richly illustrated volume provides investors, economists, and financial advisors with a refined look at MPT, highlighting the rational decision-making and probability beliefs that are essential to creating and maintaining a successful portfolio today.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d5T2CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Rethinking German History (Routledge Revivals),Richard J. Evans,History,51.35 EUR,,"In Rethinking German History, first published in 1987, Richard J. Evans argues for a social-historical approach to the German past that pays equal attention to objective social structures and subjective values and experiences. If German history has been seen as an exception to the ‘normal’ development of Western society, this is not least because historians have until recently largely failed to look beyond the world of high politics, institutions, organizations and ideologies to broader historical problems of German society and German mentalities. By applying and adapting approaches learned from French and British social history as they have been developed over the last quarter of a century, it is possible to achieve a rethinking of German history which does away with many of the textbook myths that have encrusted the historiogrpahy of Germany for so long. This book will be valuable for students of German history and politics, and brings together essays widely used in teaching. Its broad coverage of social history will also be useful to all those interested in contemporary historiography or the comparative study of European history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rfpWCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Time and Power,Christopher Clark,History,,,"Inspired by the insights of Reinhart Koselleck and François Hartog, two pioneers of the ""temporal turn"" in historiography, Clark shows how Friedrich Wilhelm rejected the notion of continuity with the past, believing instead that a sovereign must liberate the state from the entanglements of tradition to choose freely among different possible futures. He demonstrates how Frederick the Great abandoned this paradigm for a neoclassical vision of history in which sovereign and state transcend time altogether, and how Bismarck believed that the statesman's duty was to preserve the timeless permanence of the state amid the torrent of historical change. Clark describes how Hitler did not seek to revolutionize history like Stalin and Mussolini, but instead sought to evade history altogether, emphasizing timeless racial archetypes and a prophetically foretold future.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sDwDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Damascus,Ross Burns,History,,,"This is the first book in English to relate the history of Damascus, bringing out the crucial role the city has played at many points in the region's past. Damascus traces the history of this colourful, significant and complex city through its physical development, from the city's emergence in around 7000 BC through the changing cavalcade of Aramaean, Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Mongol and French rulers right up to the end of Turkish control in 1918. In Damascus, every layer of the history has built precisely on top of its predecessors for at least three millennia, leaving a detailed archaeological record of one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The book looks particularly at the interplay between the western and eastern influences that have provided Damascus with such a rich past, and how this perfectly encapsulates the forces that have played over the Middle East as a whole from the earliest recorded times to the present.

The American College and University,Frederick Rudolph,Education,,,"First published in 1962, Frederick Rudolph's groundbreaking study, The American College and University, remains one of the most useful and significant works on the history of higher education in America. Bridging the chasm between educational and social history, this book was one of the first to examine developments in higher education in the context of the social, economic, and political forces that were shaping the nation at large. Surveying higher education from the colonial era through the mid-twentieth century, Rudolph explores a multitude of issues from the financing of institutions and the development of curriculum to the education of women and blacks, the rise of college athletics, and the complexities of student life. In his foreword to this new edition, John Thelin assesses the impact that Rudolph's work has had on higher education studies. The new edition also includes a bibliographic essay by Thelin covering significant works in the field that have appeared since the publication of the first edition. At a time when our educational system as a whole is under intense scrutiny, Rudolph's seminal work offers an important historical perspective on the development of higher education in the United States.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GJvHAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Gates of Europe,Serhii Plokhy,History,,,"Ukraine is currently embroiled in a tense battle with Russia to preserve its economic and political independence. But today's conflict is only the latest in a long history of battles over Ukraine's existence as a sovereign nation. As award-winning historian Serhii Plokhy argues in The Gates of Europe, we must examine Ukraine's past in order to understand its fraught present and likely future. Situated between Europe, Russia, and the Asian East, Ukraine was shaped by the empires that have used it as a strategic gateway between East and West—from the Romans and Ottomans to the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, all have engaged in global fights for supremacy on Ukrainian soil. Each invading army left a lasting mark on the landscape and on the population, making modern Ukraine an amalgam of competing cultures.

Aron also examines French imperialism through the examples of Algeria and Indochina, as well as America's role as an ""imperial republic"" during and after World War II. Aron was never orthodox in his ideology; neither his republican political penchants nor his dialectical intellectual orientation ever gained the upper hand over his devotion to empirical reality. The result here is an intellectual history that seems less concerned about where it falls on the political spectrum than about getting it right.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Ac5DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Third Reich in History and Memory,Richard J. Evans,History,,,"In the seventy years since the demise of the Third Reich, there has been a significant transformation in the ways in which the modern world understands Nazism. In this brilliant and eye-opening collection, Richard J. Evans, the acclaimed author of the Third Reich trilogy, offers a critical commentary on that transformation, exploring how major changes in perspective have informed research and writing on the Third Reich in recent years. Drawing on his most notable writings from the last two decades, Evans reveals the shifting perspectives on Nazism's rise to political power, its economic intricacies, and its subterranean extension into postwar Germany. Evans considers how the Third Reich is increasingly viewed in a broader international context, as part of the age of imperialism; discusses the growing emphasis on the larger economic and cultural circumstances of the era; and emphasizes the development of research into Nazi society, particularly in the understanding of Nazi Germany as a political system based on popular approval and consent. Exploring the complex relationship between memory and history, Evans also points out the places where the growing need to confront the misdeeds of Nazism and expose the complicity of those who participated has led to crude and sweeping condemnation, when instead historians should be making careful distinctions. Written with Evans' sharp-eyed insight and characteristically compelling style, these essays offer a summation of the collective cultural memory of Nazism in the present, and suggest the degree to which memory must be subjected to the close scrutiny of history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g63qBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The New History,Alun Munslow,,,,"The notion of 'history' has always been one strenuously debated by both academics and the wider population. This deeply provocative re-thinking of our engagement with the past by one of the world's leading post-modern historians takes that debate one step further. Alun Munslow re-assesses history in the light of post-modernism and other intellectual challenges which have questioned the primacy of the modernist epistemology of empiricism. In an original and stimulating vision of history that will intrigue all those seriously interested in the subject, Munslow argues that history is not only about the sources, but a literary construction. Munslow concludes that history, as a cultural narrative about the past can never tell us what the past really means. This far reaching conclusion is based on the radical idea that the content of history is defined as much by the nature of the language used to represent and interpret that content as it is by research into the sources. This suggests that history does not produce the most likely meaning of the past but rather can only generate alternative meanings. The lead volume in a major new series on historical thinking and practice, this is an accessible yet absorbing study that breaks new ground in discussing the stage history is at now, and perhaps most engagingly, the direction it will take in the future.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uPzKswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Invisible Man,H. G Wells,,,,"Cursed by his own invention, a brilliant scientist is driven to a life of crime in this groundbreaking novel from a master of mystery and science fictionThe Invisible Man is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells published in 1897. Originally serialized in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it absorbs and reflects no light and thus becomes invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but fails in his attempt to reverse the procedure.Amazon.com ReviewWe rely, in this world, on the visual aspects of humanity as a means of learning who we are. This, Ralph Ellison argues convincingly, is a dangerous habit. A classic from the moment it first appeared in 1952, Invisible Man chronicles the travels of its narrator, a young, nameless black man, as he moves through the hellish levels of American intolerance and cultural blindness. Searching for a context in which to know himself, he exists in a very peculiar state. ""I am an invisible man,"" he says in his prologue. ""When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination--indeed, everything and anything except me."" But this is hard-won self-knowledge, earned over the course of many years.As the book gets started, the narrator is expelled from his Southern Negro college for inadvertently showing a white trustee the reality of black life in the south, including an incestuous farmer and a rural whorehouse. The college director chastises him: ""Why, the dumbest black bastard in the cotton patch knows that the only way to please a white man is to tell him a lie! What kind of an education are you getting around here?"" Mystified, the narrator moves north to New York City, where the truth, at least as he perceives it, is dealt another blow when he learns that his former headmaster's recommendation letters are, in fact, letters of condemnation.What ensues is a search for what truth actually is, which proves to be supremely elusive. The narrator becomes a spokesman for a mixed-race band of social activists called ""The Brotherhood"" and believes he is fighting for equality. Once again, he realizes he's been duped into believing what he thought was the truth, when in fact it is only another variation. Of the Brothers, he eventually discerns:",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cTcTzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Dust of the Desert (Classic Reprint),Robert Welles Ritchie,,,,"Excerpt from Dust of the Desert Roads of men thread the worlds. They thunder with a life flood. They are vibrant with a pulse of affairs. By land and water and air they link to-day to to-morrow. But El Camino de los Muertos (the Road of the Dead Men) is a dim highway leading nowhere but back and back to forgotten yesterdays. Its faint sign-posts once were, vivid in lettering of tears and blood. Its stages were measured by the sum of all human hardihood. Faith, valour, reckless adventuring, thirst for gold, love o' women - these the links in the measuring chain that marked its course through a dead land. And black crosses formed of lava stones laid down in the sand; these abide over all the length of the Road of the Dead Men from Caborca to Yuma to cry to the white-hot sky of slain hopes and faith betrayed in those buried years gone.

The Collector of Lost Things,Jeremy Page,Arctic regions,,,"The worlds of ocean and ice were meeting in a frontier of rage, as if the Earth had torn in two along this line. This was a place, if there ever was a place, where you could disappear. The year is 1845 and young researcher Eliot Saxby is paid to go on an expedition to the Arctic in the hope of finding remains of the by now extinct Great Auk. He joins a regular hunting ship, but the crew and the passengers are not what they seem. Caught in the web of relationships on board, Eliot struggles to understand the motivations of the sociopathic, embroidery-loving Captain Sykes, the silent First Mate French, the flamboyant laudanum-addicted Bletchley and, most importantly of all, Bletchley's beautiful but strange 'cousin' Clara. As the ship moves further and further into the wilds of the Arctic sea, Eliot clings to what he believes in, desperate to save Clara but drawn irrevocably back into the past that haunts him.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aA-OMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
In the Hands of the Unknown,A. E. Hellstorm,,,,"The dead girl in the morgue wasn't more than ten years old. As a Field Researcher within the FBI, agent Miriam Goldblum has seen many tragic deaths, but this girl... she was special. She had been eaten alive from the inside. For six years, Miriam has worked with cases like this; cases that step over that precious line of normal and throws her deep into a dark and shadowy world of supernatural crimes. She has forgotten how to sleep without nightmares, and she never lets out the light, terrified that the darkness will find her even at her own home. Together with her mentor and fiance Henry, and her grumpy co-worker Carl, Miriam tries to find the people responsible for the girl's death, but soon she and her team realize that they might be the next victims themselves. Will they be able to solve this case without horrible losses for themselves, or is this the dreaded 'last-case-scenario' that they willingly are walking into?",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SOTuswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Lighter Side of Irish Life (Classic Reprint),George A. Birmingham,Biography & Autobiography,,,"Excerpt from The Lighter Side of Irish Life Thus a mythical Irishman has come into be ing, a sentimentalist at heart, a creature of ir responsible gaiety, of singular and irresistible charm of manner, of spontaneous brilliance, a light lover of every pretty woman, or in cases where he happens himself to be a woman, a careless winner of the hearts of men. It is small wonder that the Irish are popular with writers of fiction. We supply for the novelist a long felt want, and are fitted to play In his stories just those parts which throw into the strongest relief the stable worthiness of the ideal, and, I fear, equally mythical, Englishman. The reader of contemporary fiction can hardly fail to be struck with the fact that a dash Of Irish blood in her veins is now considered necessary as an explanation of the charm of a heroine, that true gallantry in a hero can only be rendered credible by providing him with at least a great grandmother who belonged to an old Irish fam ily. This myth about the Irish character is of comparatively recent growth. The older novel ists knew nothing of it. They either despised us too much to put us into their books at all, or.

The Lost Valley of Iskander,Robert E. Howard,Fiction,6.41 EUR,,"This early work by Robert E. Howard was originally published in the 20th century and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. 'The Lost Valley of Iskander' is a story in the El Borak series where El Borak discovers the Greek descendants of Alexander the Great. Robert Ervin Howard was born in Peaster, Texas in 1906. During his youth, his family moved between a variety of Texan boomtowns, and Howard - a bookish and somewhat introverted child - was steeped in the violent myths and legends of the Old South. At fifteen Howard began to read the pulp magazines of the day, and to write more seriously. The December 1922 issue of his high school newspaper featured two of his stories, 'Golden Hope Christmas' and 'West is West'. In 1924 he sold his first piece - a short caveman tale titled 'Spear and Fang' - for $16 to the not-yet-famous Weird Tales magazine. Howard's most famous character, Conan the Cimmerian, was a barbarian-turned-King during the Hyborian Age, a mythical period of some 12,000 years ago. Conan featured in seventeen Weird Tales stories between 1933 and 1936 which is why Howard is now regarded as having spawned the 'sword and sorcery' genre. The Conan stories have since been adapted many times, most famously in the series of films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0pR-CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
The Divorce Revolution,Lenore J. Weitzman,Family & Relationships,,1,"Based upon interviews with judges, lawyers, and divorced persons in California, and data collected from that state#x19;s court dockets, this volume presents the first systematic examination of the social and economic effects of divorce law reform. Sociologist Weitzman concludes that while the abolition of grounds, fault, and consent has eliminated much of the acrimony previously associated with divorce proceedings, this, together with the institution of gender-neutral standards for property awards and child support, has resulted in increased economic hardship and social dislocation for divorced women and dependent children. Weitzman does not intend to extrapolate her data, conclusions, and recommendations to the whole country; however, it is reasonable to believe that they have national implications.

Africa,John Reader,History,,,"In 1978, paleontologists in East Africa discovered the earliest evidence of our divergence from the apes: three pre-human footprints, striding away from a volcano, were preserved in the petrified surface of a mudpan over three million years ago. Out of Africa, the world's most ancient and stable landmass, Homo sapiens dispersed across the globe. And yet the continent that gave birth to human history has long been woefully misunderstood and mistreated by the rest of the world. In a book as splendid in its wealth of information as it is breathtaking in scope, British writer and photojournalist John Reader brings to light Africa's geology and evolution, the majestic array of its landforms and environments, the rich diversity of its peoples and their ways of life, the devastating legacies of slavery and colonialism as well as recent political troubles and triumphs.

The Cambridge Introduction to Scenography,"Joslin McKinney, Philip Butterworth",Drama,,,"Scenography - the manipulation and orchestration of the performance environment - is an increasingly popular and key area in performance studies. This book introduces the reader to the purpose, identity and scope of scenography and its theories and concepts. Settings and structures, light, projected images, sound, costumes and props are considered in relation to performing bodies, text, space and the role of the audience. Concentrating on scenographic developments in the twentieth century, the Introduction examines how these continue to evolve in the twenty-first century. Scenographic principles are clearly explained through practical examples and their theoretical context. Although acknowledging the many different ways in which design shapes the creation of scenography, the book is not exclusively concerned with the role of the theatre designer. In order to map out the wider territory and potential of scenography, the theories of pioneering scenographers are discussed alongside the work of directors, writers and visual artists.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vliatAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Iconography of Independence,"Robert Holland, Susan Williams, Terry Barringer",History,,,"This book explores the phenomenon of Independence Days. These rituals had complex meanings both in the territories concerned and in Britain as the imperial metropole, where they were extensively reported in the press. The text is concerned with the political management, associated rhetoric and iconography of these seminal celebrations.

Highlights of the book include an overview by David Cannadine relating the topic to ornamentalism, invented tradition and transitions in British culture. Although the book is mainly concerned with the British Empire, Martin Shipway âe"" a leading historian and cultural analyst of French decolonization âe"" contributes an acute summary of how the same âe~momentâe(tm) was handled differently in the other great European empires. There are detailed and lively studies by noted specialists of the immediate coming of Independence to India/Pakistan, Malaya, Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Guyana.

Bloodied Banners,Robert W. Jones,Antiques & Collectibles,,,"Groundbreaking reassessment of the role played by armour, weapons and heraldry in medieval warfare, showing their cultural as well as military significance. `A penetrating investigation of medieval martial display... The reader is struck by its originality, and by its sophisticated and critical interpretative engagement with historical and literary sources. Particularly notable is the author's subtle exploration of the function of armour: not only its practical role, but as a form of display... A refreshingly different approach to the world of the medieval combatant and his place within that ""host of many colours"" that was a medieval army, it adds a new dimension to our understanding of medieval warfare.' Dr ANDREW AYTON, Senior Lecturer in History, University of Hull The medieval battlefield was a place of spectacle and splendour. The fully-armed knight, bedecked in his vivid heraldic colours, mounted on his great charger, riding out beneath his brightly-painted banner, is a stock image of war and the warrior in the middle ages. Yet too often the significance of such display has been ignored or dismissed as the empty preening of a militaristic social elite. Drawing on a broad range of source material and using innovative historical approaches, this book completely re-evaluates the way that such men and their weapons were viewed, showing that martial display was a vital part of the way in which war was waged in the middle ages. It maintains that heraldry and livery served not only to advertise a warrior's family and social ties, but also announced his presence on the battlefield and right to wage war. It also considers the physiological and psychological effect of wearing armour, both on the wearer and those facing him in combat, arguing that the need for display in battle was deeper than any medieval cultural construct and was based in the fundamental biological drives of threat and warning.

It is in manner impressionistic and descriptive rather than systematic and formal; Frances Donovan, the author, is rather more interested in the his tory than in the sociology Of contemporary life. The book she has written, because Of its exploratory character, has more the character of a personal narrative and a report of observations than of a systematic treatise. It is written, one may perhaps say, from the point of View Of what Lindeman aptly calls the participant Observer. The author has been able to enter sympathetically and understandingly into the experiences Of the persons whose lives she depicts, but at the same time she is keenly alive to the larger implications Of her own experiences and those of the women with whom she is associated.

Upon a Dark Night,Peter Lovesey,Amnesia,,,"Peter Diamond, the traditionalist dinosaur of Bath CID, finds the low murder rate in the city a touch frustrating, so he decides to check whether a couple of suicides which his colleague is investigating have been accurately classified. On the outskirts of the city a woman is found unconscious in a hospital car park, but when she recovers she can't remember who she is or how she came to be there. Soon after she is released into the care of the local authority, Diamond has a 'proper' case to get his teeth into when a woman's body is found in the garden of a flat after a somewhat drunken party. None of the other guests knew her and it is not clear whether she slipped, jumped or was pushed, and with no clue as to her identity Diamond has a puzzle to satisfy his quirky talents.

The Peloponnesian War,John Francis Lazenby,History,,,"The range and extent of the Peloponnesian War of the fifth century BC has led to it being described as a 'world war' in miniature. With the struggle between Athens and Sparta at its core, the twenty-seven-year conflict drew in states from all points of the compass; from Byzantion in the north, Crete in the south, Asia Minor in the east and Sicily in the west. Since Thucydides described the war as 'the greatest disturbance to befall the Greeks' numerous studies have been made of individual episodes and topics. This authoritative work is the first single-volume study of the entire war to be published in over seventy-five years. Lazenby avoids the tendency of allowing historiography to obscure the analysis, and while paying due attention to detail, also looks at the fundamental questions of warfare raised by the conflict. Within a narrative framework, Lazenby concentrates on the fighting itself, and examining the way in which both strategy and tactics developed as the conflict spread. Not afraid to challenge accepted views, he assesses the war as a military rather than a political endeavour, evaluating issues such as the advantages and limitations of sea power. A readable and clear survey, this text offers a balanced discussion of controversial themes, and will appeal to ancient historians, classicists and all those who are interested in military history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYOTmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

What's the Least I Can Believe and Still be a Christian?,Martin Thielen,Religion,,,"Pastor and author Martin Thielen has compiled a list of ten things people need to believe, and ten things they don't, in order to be a Christian. This lively and engaging book will be a help to seekers as well as a comfort to believers who may find themselves questioning some of the assumptions they grew up with. With an accessible, storytelling style that's grounded in solid biblical scholarship, Thielen shows how Christians don't need to believe that sinners will be ""left behind"" to burn in hell or that it's heresy to believe in evolution. And while we must always take the Bible seriously, we don't always have to take it literally. At the same time, Christians do need to believe in Jesus--his life, his teachings, his death and resurrection, and his vision for the world. A great benefit of those beliefs is that they provide promising answers to life's most profound questions, including: Where is God? What matters most? What brings fulfillment? What about suffering? Is there hope? Thielen articulates centrist, mainline Christianity in a way that's fresh and easy to understand, and offers authentic Christian insights that speak to our deepest needs. This new edition includes a leader's guide, previously only available online, and a new introduction from the author that reflects on the book's reception. The leader's guide features unique and easily implemented aids for carrying out a seven-week, congregation-wide initiative that will help local churches reach out to their communities.

A Satire Anthology,Carolyn Wells,Poetry,,,"From the INTRODUCTION: SATIRE, though a form of literature familiar to everyone, is difficult to define. Partaking variously of sarcasm, irony, ridicule, and burlesque, it is exactly synonymous with no one of these. Satire is primarily dependent on the motive of its writer. Unless meant for satire, it is not the real thing; unconscious satire is a contradiction of terms, or a mere figure of speech. Secondarily, satire depends on the reader. What seems to us satire to-day, may not seem so tomorrow. Or, what seems satire to a pessimistic mind, may seem merely good-natured chaff to an optimist. This, of course, refers to the subtler forms of satire. Many classic satires are direct lampoons or broadsides which admit of only one interpretation. Literature numbers many satirists among its most honoured names; and the best satires show intellect, education, and a keen appreciation of human nature. Nor is satire necessarily vindictive or spiteful. Often its best examples show a kindly tolerance for the vice or folly in question, and even hint a tacit acceptance of the conditions condemned. Again, in the hands of a carping and unsympathetic critic, satire is used with vitriolic effects on sins for which the writer has no mercy. This lashing form of satire was doubtless the earliest type. The Greeks show sardonic examples of it, but the Romans allowed a broader sense of humour to soften the satirical sting. Following and outstripping Lucilius, Horace is the acknowledged father of satire, and was himself followed, and, in the opinion of some, outstripped by Juvenal. But the works of the ancient satirists are of interest mainly to scholars, and cannot be included in a collection destined for a popular audience. The present volume, therefore, is largely made up from the products of more recent centuries. From the times of Horace and Juvenal, down through the mediaeval ages to the present day, satires may be divided into the two classes founded by the two great masters: the work of Horace''s followers marked by humour and tolerance, that of Juvenal''s imitators by bitter invective. On the one side, the years have arrayed such names as Chaucer, Swift, Goldsmith, and Thackeray; on the other, Langland, Dryden, Pope, and Burns. A scholarly gentleman of our own day classifies satires in three main divisions: those directed at society, those which ridicule political conditions, and those aimed at individual characters. These variations of the art of satire form a fascinating study, and to one interested in the subject, this small collection of representative satires can be merely a series of guide-posts. It is the compiler''s regret that a great mass of material is necessarily omitted for lack of space; other selections are discarded because of their present untimeliness, which deprives them of their intrinsic interest. But an endeavour has been made to represent the greatest and best satiric writers, and also to include at least extracts from the masterpieces of satire. It is often asked why we have no satire at the present day. Many answers have been given, but one reason is doubtless to be found in the acceleration of the pace of life; fads and foibles follow one another so quickly, that we have time neither to write nor read satiric disquisitions upon them. Another reason lies in the fact that we have achieved a broader and more tolerant human outlook. Again, the true satirist must he possessed of earnestness and sincerity. And it is a question whether the mental atmosphere of the twentieth century tends to stimulate and foster those qualities. These explanations, however, seem to apply to American writers more especially than to English. The leisurely thinking Briton, with his more personal viewpoint, has produced, and is even now producing, satires marked by strength....",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VC7uzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Tribulations of a Chinaman in China,Jules Verne,,,,"Kin-Fo, a well to do Chinese man living in Shang-Hai, is accused by his good friend Wang of not having had any discomforts in his life that would make him appreciate true happiness. When Kin-Fo, receives news that his fortune is lost, he arranges for an insurance policy to be taken out on his life that would cover his death, even by suicide; which he is planning on committing. When Kin-Fo can't bring himself to end his own life, he contracts Wang to do it, by even giving him a letter that will exonerate him of the deed. Then Wang disappears and then Kin-Fo feels much discomfort, especially when he is informed that his fortunes are not lost. He travels around China, hoping to avoid being murdered before the contract expires. His discomfort increases when a note from Wang arrives saying that he regrets not being able to fulfill the contract, so he has turned it over to his old friend Lao-Shen, a notorious character.Jules Gabriel Verne was a French author who helped pioneer the science-fiction genre. He is best known for novels such as A Journey to the Centre of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Verne is often referred to as the ""Father of science fiction"" as he wrote about space, air, and underwater travel before navigable aircraft and practical submarines were invented, and before any means of space travel had been devised.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IadGzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Flush: a Biography,Virginia Woolf,,,,"Flush: A Biography, an imaginative biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's cocker spaniel, is a cross-genre blend of fiction and nonfiction.Commonly read as a modernist consideration of city life seen through the eyes of a dog, Flush serves as a harsh criticism of the supposedly unnatural ways of living in the city. The figure of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the text is often read as an analogue for other female intellectuals, like Woolf herself, who suffered from illness, feigned or real, as a part of their status as female writers. Most insightful and experimental are Woolf's emotional and philosophical views verbalized in Flush's thoughts. As he spends more time with Barrett Browning, Flush becomes emotionally and spiritually connected to the poetess and both begin to understand each other despite their language barriers.",

The Economic Impact of a Growth Rate Ordinance in the City of Santa Fe,"Lee A. Reynis, Tony Sylvester, Santa Fe (N.M.)",Cities and towns,,,,
A Twist of Faith,John Donnelly,Religion,,,"American Christians, veteran reporter John Donnelly has discovered, are an ever-increasing source of aid in Africa, with some experts estimating that U.S. churches supply more resources to Africa than USAID. In A Twist of Faith, he tells the unlikely story of how faith and determination compelled one such American Christian to travel to Africa and open a school for children orphaned by the AIDS epidemic. David Nixon, a carpenter from North Carolina who had lived through his share of trouble, knew nothing about the small, land-locked African country of Malawi. But after having a religious awakening and hearing about a preacher's efforts to aid its impoverished and beleaguered citizens, he raises money from his church and sets off to do what so many well-intentioned Americans of faith do in Africa: build an orphanage. But as his plans are beset with difficulties, Nixon slowly comes to realize that helping others requires listening to and learning from them. And that means changing his preconceived ideas of what the Malawians need and how he can best serve them. A Twist of Faith is the story of one man who, despite personal struggles, a profound cultural gap, the corruption of local officials, and the heartbreak of losing an orphan he comes to love, saves himself by saving others in a place nothing like home. Nixon's story is representative of a growing trend: the thousands of American Christians who are impassioned donors of time, money, and personal energy, devoted to helping African children.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ib9vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
A Bid for Fortune Or Dr Nikola's Vendetta Illustrated,Guy Boothby,,,,"London, the decadent 1890s: a mysterious meeting is called in a private room of the sumptuous Imperial Hotel. The sinister Dr Nikola is presiding, but what masterpiece of crime is he planning? Meanwhile, in Sydney, Australia, a rugged young man rescues a girl from attack by ruffians. These two events are skilfully woven together in one of the classics of late Victorian crime fiction. Before his tragically early death, Boothby lived his life equally in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and in this novel he creates a narrative that moves breathtakingly from the West and East Ends of London to a thrilling climax in the South Seas via Egypt and Australia",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S0sAzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
The Diary of a Nobody,"Weedon Grossmith, George Grossmith",,,,"The Diary of a Nobody is so unassuming a work that even its author, George Grossmith, seemed unaware that he had produced a masterpiece. For more than a century this wonderfully comic portrayal of suburban life and values has remained in print, a source of delight to generations of readers, and a major literary influence, much imitated but never equalled. I fail to see - because I do not happen to be a 'Somebody' - why my diary should not be interesting. Mr Pooter is a man of modest ambitions, content with his ordinary life. Yet he always seems to be troubled by disagreeable tradesmen, impertinent young office clerks and wayward friends, not to mention his devil-may-care son Lupin with his unsuitable choice of bride. Try as he might, he cannot avoid life's embarrassing mishaps. In the bumbling, absurd, yet ultimately endearing figure of Pooter, the Grossmiths created an immortal comic character and a superb satire on the snobberies of middle-class suburbia - one which also sends up late Victorian crazes for spiritualism and bicycling, as well as the fashion for publishing diaries by anybody and everybody.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XILuxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
A Balthus Notebook,Guy Davenport,Art,,,"In his 1989 book on Balthus—the storied and controversial artist who worked in Paris throughout the twentieth century—Guy Davenport gives one of the most nuanced, literary, and compelling readings of the work of this master. Reading it today highlights the change in perspectives on sexuality and nudity in art in the past thirty years. Written over several years in his notebooks, Davenport’s distinct reflections on Balthus’s paintings try to explain why his work is so radical, and why it has so often come under scrutiny for its depiction of girls and women. Davenport throws the lens back on the viewer and asks: is it us or Balthus who reads sexuality into these paintings? For Davenport, the answer is clear: Balthus may indeed show us periods in adolescent development that are uncomfortable to view, but the eroticization exists primarily on the part of the viewer. Arguing that Balthus’s figures are erotic only if we make them so, and that their innocence is more present than anything pornographic in them, Davenport posits that the paintings hold up a mirror to our own perversities and force us, difficultly, to confront them. He writes, “The nearer an artist works to the erotic politics of his own culture, the more he gets its concerned attention. Gauguin’s naked Polynesian girls, brown and remote, escape the scandal of Balthus’s, although a Martian observer would not see the distinction.” Davenport’s critique helps us understand Balthus in our times—something we need more than ever as we crucially confront sexual politics in visual art.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cvLwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
The Romance of a Midshipman (Classic Reprint),William Clark Russell,,,,"Excerpt from The Romance of a Midshipman I was at Bouville, a little dusky seaport situated on the French coast betwixt Brest and placid old Calais. One long pier strikes fang-like with a flash into the breaches of the sea and the wild play of foam makes a light for that gray and gloomy harbor. The gloom is in the black timbers of pier, in the dark green sheathing of seaweed, in an appearance of darkness in the water where it spreads its inmost extremity. Bouville is full of churches. It may be that in my time you might count one for every hundred head of man and woman. Better for the inhabitants if their spires were of commerce, and smoked; but the weather-cock darts a flame as it revolves, and is an ornament in the air. The harbor is the pleasantest part. I always thought it so when a boy. I was fascinated by the clumsy black smacks, and their huge chocolate lugs, and their deck-loads of gabbling, sprawling men, and noisy, gesticulating women, in immense caps and shining earrings. These poor people are very devout. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner Illustrated,James Hogg,,,,"""The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner: Written by Himself: With a detail of curious traditionary facts and other evidence by the editor is a novel by the Scottish author James Hogg, published anonymously in 1824.Considered by turns part-gothic novel, part-psychological mystery, part-metafiction, part-satire, part-case study of totalitarian thought, it can also be thought of as an early example of modern crime fiction in which the story is told, for the most part, from the point of view of its criminal anti-hero. The action of the novel is located in a historically definable Scotland with accurately observed settings, and simultaneously implies a pseudo-Christian world of angels, devils, and demonic possession. The narrative is set against the antinomian societal structure flourishing in the borders of Scotland in Hogg's day.""",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fDBqzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
Finding Home,Marissa A. Cheng,,,,"Is homelessness a problem? What if you considered homelessness to be a state, rather than a problem, and provided for it accordingly in the urban landscape? As roads and water and sewer lines are one type of infrastructure, a diverse mix of dwelling types is another kind of infrastructure - the infrastructure in which we live. This thesis looks at the way the homeless have sheltered themselves in the past, and comes to several conclusions about how they might be sheltered in the future such that homelessness becomes a natural part of the urban landscape. Through this process of changing societal attitudes through the design of physical space, homelessness loses its label of ""problem"" and becomes more accepted as a way of life.",

A Responsive Spouse,Mary Muinamu Muinamu,,,,"Our relationships define every aspect of our lives. Our behaviors, attitudes, actions, values, and beliefs are shaped through our life Relationships. Almost all of us have experienced emotional, physical, and even psychological hurts and wounds from our relationships with parents, siblings, lovers, colleagues, and friends in society. Mary Muinamu is a counseling psychologist, relationship coach, and founder of Relationships Powerlift. Her passion for healthy relationships developed at a very tender age when she noticed that many people were struggling with relationships, especially in marriage. This desire for flourishing relationships drove her into studying Counseling Psychology and writing this book. A responsive spouse is an initial step in dealing with some of these issues. A spouse who is receptive to their spouse's needs is likely to understand them more, minimize conflict, and handle them appropriately. A responsive spouse enlightens and enables you to spot and identify your spouse's various needs and address them accordingly. It also helps to bring healing to hurting marriages. It is an eye-opener for those who are single and those who are married. This book will not leave you the same. It has a wealth of knowledge that many people discover after many years of marriage. I t is not a mystery to come to terms with your spouse's needs and be in a position to meet them. We all understand that we need to meet each other's needs, but we sometimes try to assume this for whatever reasons. However, this is for our good if we want a happy and lasting relationship. Many people argue that people change after marriage. However, this is not the case. Most likely, those who seem to change after union were acting during courtship because they never wanted to lose their spouse. That is why even when you start a relationship, it should be normal to disagree on some things. The nature of man is to put a facade and especially to those he or she wants to deceive with his or her reputation. However, a natural person who is true to himself or herself does not mind what the other person might think of him or her as long as he is true to himself or herself. A real man or woman will love you for who you are and learn to accommodate your weaknesses. I am that kind of a person whereby if I decide I will not do something, I will not do it no matter what. I did not know my husband was interested in me when we were young and single, and this aspect of my character used to come out quite often. 109 A Responsive Spouse When he proposed, I remember I asked him how daring he was to love me with that character. His response to me was, ""I knew you were not acting. I also wanted someone who could challenge me.""Develop your character and be you. The things you consider off and unpleasing may not be as bad as you think before your lover; let them come out.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=psi2zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Africa,John Reader,History,,,"In 1978, paleontologists in East Africa discovered the earliest evidence of our divergence from the apes: three pre-human footprints, striding away from a volcano, were preserved in the petrified surface of a mudpan over three million years ago. Out of Africa, the world's most ancient and stable landmass, Homo sapiens dispersed across the globe. And yet the continent that gave birth to human history has long been woefully misunderstood and mistreated by the rest of the world. In a book as splendid in its wealth of information as it is breathtaking in scope, British writer and photojournalist John Reader brings to light Africa's geology and evolution, the majestic array of its landforms and environments, the rich diversity of its peoples and their ways of life, the devastating legacies of slavery and colonialism as well as recent political troubles and triumphs.

Understanding Extreme Sports: A Psychological Perspective,"Eric Brymer, Francesco Feletti, Erik Monasterio, Robert D. Schweitzer",,,,"Extreme sports, those activities that lie on the outermost edges of independent adventurous leisure activities, where a mismanaged mistake or accident would most likely result in death, have developed into a significant worldwide phenomenon (Brymer & Schweitzer, 2017a). Extreme sport activities are continually evolving, typical examples include BASE (an acronym for Buildings, Antennae, Span, Earth) jumping and related activities such as proximity flying, extreme skiing, big wave surfing, waterfall kayaking, rope free solo climbing and high-level mountaineering. While participant numbers in many traditional team and individual sports such as golf, basketball and racket sports have declined over the last decade or so, participant numbers in so called extreme sports have surged. Although extreme sports are still assumed to be a Western pastime, there has been considerable Global uptake. Equally, the idea that adventure sports are only for the young is also changing as participation rates across the generations are growing. For example, baby boomers are enthusiastic participants of adventure sports more generally (Brymer & Schweitzer, 2017b; Patterson, 2002) and Generation Z turn to extreme sports because they are popular and linked to escapism (Giannoulakis & Pursglove, 2017). Arguably, extreme sports now support a multi-billion dollar industry and the momentum seems to be intensifying. Traditional explanations for why extreme sports have become so popular are varied. For some, the popularity is explained as the desire to rebel against a society that is becoming too risk averse, for others it is about the spectacle and the merchandise that is associated with organised activities and athletes. For others it is just that there are a lot of people attracted by risk and danger or just want to show off. For others still it is about the desire to belong to sub-cultures and the glamour that goes with extreme sports. Some seek mastery in their chosen activity and in situations of significant challenges. This confusion is unfortunate as despite their popularity there is still a negative perception about extreme sports participation. There is a pressing need for clarity. The dominant research perspective has focused on positivist theory-driven perspectives that attempt to match extreme sports against predetermined characteristics. For the most part empirical research has conformed to predetermined societal perspectives. Other ways of knowing might reveal more nuanced perspectives of the human dimension of extreme sport participation. This special edition brings together cutting-edge research and thought examining psychology and extreme sports, with particular attention payed to the examination of motivations for initial participation, continued participation, effective performance, and outcomes from participation.

Atari Design,Raiford Guins,Design,27.63 EUR,,"Drawing from deep archival research and extensive interviews, Atari Design is a rich, historical study of how Atari's industrial and graphic designers contributed to the development of the video game machine. Innovative game design played a key role in the growth of Atari – from Pong to Asteroids and beyond – but fun, challenging and exciting game play was not unique to the famous Silicon Valley company. What set it apart from its competitors was innovation in the coin-op machine's cabinet. Atari did not just make games, it designed products for environments. With “tasteful packaging”, Atari exceeded traditional locations like bars, amusement parks and arcades, developing the look and feel of their game cabinets for new locations such as fast food restaurants, department stores, country clubs, university unions, and airports, making game-play a ubiquitous social and cultural experience. By actively shaping the interaction between user and machine, overcoming styling limitations and generating a distinct corporate identity, Atari designed products that impacted the everyday visual and material culture of the late 20th century. Design was never an afterthought at Atari.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RT72DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Teaching Lifetime Outdoor Pursuits,"Jeff Steffen, Jim Stiehl",Education,,,"Do you want to help your middle and high school students become more resilient and patient, acquire new skills, and sharpen their problem-solving abilities while feeling competent and good about themselves? If you do, then TeachingLifetime Outdoor Pursuits is the ideal tool for you. Editors Jeff Steffen and Jim Stiehl are nationally known physical educators with extensive experience in outdoor education teaching and teacher training. They brought together some of the nation's foremost experts in specific outdoor pursuits--such as bouldering, caving, rock climbing, and orienteering--to craft a book designed for physical educators who either have outdoor programs or who want to use outdoor activities in their traditional PE programs. The 12 topics included in Teaching Lifetime Outdoor Pursuits represent the outdoor pursuits that show the greatest growth in traditional PE programs. With each pursuit, students can challenge themselves and spend time outside of the customary classroom context while sharing an adventure with their teachers that can create a profoundly different student-teacher relationship. Teaching Lifetime Outdoor Pursuits is a comprehensive resource whose ideas and content can be incorporated into a traditional PE program regardless of geographic location. The activities for each pursuit align with NASPE content standards. For each pursuit, you are given detailed information on equipment needed, basic skills and techniques required, teaching strategies, safety considerations, and additional resources. In addition, Teaching Lifetime Outdoor Pursuits offers * clear instruction on what to teach, how to teach it, and how to assess student learning; * an attached CD-ROM that supplies objectives, sample lessons, sample assessments, and universal programming ideas for each outdoor pursuit presented in the book; and * information to help you advocate for adding outdoor activities to your program. This authoritative resource will help you ""leave no child inside"" as you teach pursuits that not only get kids outside now but also help them develop a lifetime habit of outdoor enjoyment.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oIvgICgXXjQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Erich Wolfgang Korngold's The Adventures of Robin Hood,Ben Winters,Music,53.15 EUR,,"Among the many fine examples of film scores by Erich Wolfgang Korngold (1897-1957), the score for The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) stands out the most. Winner of the Academy AwardTM for best dramatic score in 1938, it is seen by many as the archetypal accompaniment to a Warner Brothers swashbuckler, and it established Korngold as one of the leading exponents of film score composition at a formative point in its history. In Erich Wolfgang Korngold's The Adventures of Robin Hood: A Film Score Guide, author Ben Winters uses manuscript and archival research to challenge preconceived notions about the score's composer and its authorship. In the first two chapters, Winters examines Korngold's career on its own and in relation to the film, including his background in composing concert music and opera, his film scoring techniques, and his engagement with the Hollywood studio system. Chapter three focuses on the Robin Hood film while placing Korngold's music in a larger framework. It examines the film's treatment of the Robin Hood legend, its historical and critical contexts, and its place within the swashbuckler genre and the studio's anti-fascist agenda. While looking closely at the composer's work on this score, chapter four shows sources Korngold used, the music's production process, and the changes the score had undergone. The book concludes with a thematic analysis and reading of the score, identifying the various musical 'voices' that the listener weaves together as he or she experiences the film. This detailed consideration of Korngold's masterpiece will be continually turned to by film and music scholars alike.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NgB4EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Bruce Walker Travel Adventures,Bruce Walker,Travel,,,"Learn about the human experience of loss of a loved one and coming to terms with the grief. A few years after losing his spouse, Bruce Walker spent the summer of 2012 touring Canada from Nova Scotia right across the country up to Dawson City and Whitehorse, Yukon. From there he traversed British Columbia, including his birthplace on Vancouver Island. With only his trusty Rav4, a foam mattress, his rooftop carrier and many memories, Bruce reconnected with places and people and even family he hadn’t seen in decades. And along the way he reconnected with himself and came to a life-altering realization: he was learning to live with the past rather than living in the past. Come along as Bruce explores Canada, revels in its beauty and finds his place in it as he enters the third act of his life – retirement and travel adventures. Bruce’s bucket list is a long one.

The Future of Seduction,Mia Levitin,Social Science,,,"Where and who do we want to be? How might we get there? What might happen if we stay on our current course? In The Future of Seduction, cultural and literary critic Mia Levitin explores the future of sex, asking powerful and necessary questions about the relationships of tomorrow. This brief but mighty book is one of five that comprise the first set of FUTURES essays. Each standalone book presents the author's original vision of a singular aspect of the future which inspires in them hope or reticence, optimism or fear. Read individually, these essays will inform, entertain and challenge. Together, they form a picture of what might lie ahead, and ask the reader to imagine how we might make the transition from here to there, from now to then.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pQAAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
The Musical Language of Rock,David Temperley,Music,,,"In all of the books about rock music, relatively few focus on the purely musical dimensions of the style: dimensions of harmony and melody, tonality and scale, rhythm and meter, phrase structure and form, and emotional expression. The Musical Language of Rock puts forth a new, comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of rock music by addressing each of these aspects. Eastman music theorist and cognition researcher David Temperley brings together a conventional music-analytic approach with statistical corpus analysis to offer an innovative and insightful approach to the genre. With examples from across a broadly defined rock idiom encompassing everything from the Beatles to Deep Purple, Michael Jackson to Bonnie Raitt, The Musical Language of Rock shows how rock musicians exploit musical parameters to achieve aesthetic and expressive goals-for example, the manipulation of expectation and surprise, the communication of such oppositions as continuity/closure and tension/relaxation, and the expression of emotional states. A major innovation of the book is a three-dimensional model of musical expression-representing valence, energy, and tension-which proves to be a powerful tool for characterizing songs and also for tracing expressive shifts within them. The book includes many musical examples, with sound clips available on the book's website. The Musical Language of Rock presents new insights on the powerful musical mechanisms which have made rock a hallmark of our contemporary musical landscape.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wr9EDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Say No to the Devil,Ian Zack,Music,22.46 EUR,,"“Finally, the biography that Rev. Davis deserves. Ian Zack takes ‘Blind Gary’ out of the footnotes and into the footlights of the history of American music.” —Steve Katz, cofounder of Blood, Sweat & Tears Bob Dylan called Gary Davis “one of the wizards of modern music.” Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead—who took lessons with Davis—claimed his musical ability “transcended any common notion of a bluesman.” And the folklorist Alan Lomax called him “one of the really great geniuses of American instrumental music.” But you won’t find Davis alongside blues legends Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The first biography of Davis, Say No to the Devil restores “the Rev’s” remarkable story. Drawing on extensive research and interviews with many of Davis’s former students, Ian Zack takes readers through Davis’s difficult beginning as the blind son of sharecroppers in the Jim Crow South to his decision to become an ordained Baptist minister and his move to New York in the early 1940s, where he scraped out a living singing and preaching on street corners and in storefront churches in Harlem. There, he gained entry into a circle of musicians that included, among many others, Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, and Dave Van Ronk. But in spite of his tremendous musical achievements, Davis never gained broad recognition from an American public that wasn’t sure what to make of his trademark blend of gospel, ragtime, street preaching, and the blues. His personal life was also fraught, troubled by struggles with alcohol, women, and deteriorating health. Zack chronicles this remarkable figure in American music, helping us to understand how he taught and influenced a generation of musicians.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=em7_BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Birth of the English Common Law,R. C. van Caenegem,Law,,,"This book provides a challenging interpretation of the emergence of the common law in Anglo-Norman England, against the background of the general development of legal institutions in Europe. In a detailed discussion of the emergence of the central courts and the common law they administered, the author traces the rise of the writ system and the growth of the jury system in twelfth-century England. Professor van Caenegem attempts to explain why English law is so different from that on the Continent and why this divergence began in the twelfth century, arguing that chance and chronological accident played the major part and led to the paradox of a feudal law of continental origin becoming one of the most typical manifestations of English life and thought. First published in 1973, The Birth of the English Common Law has come to enjoy classical status, and in a preface Professor van Caenegem discusses some recent developments in the study of English law under the Norman and earliest Angevin kings.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RUqm4hN6OwkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Transatlantic Constitution,Mary Sarah Bilder,History,,,"Departing from traditional approaches to colonial legal history, Mary Sarah Bilder argues that American law and legal culture developed within the framework of an evolving, unwritten transatlantic constitution that lawyers, legislators, and litigants on both sides of the Atlantic understood. The central tenet of this constitution—that colonial laws and customs could not be repugnant to the laws of England but could diverge for local circumstances—shaped the legal development of the colonial world. Focusing on practices rather than doctrines, Bilder describes how the pragmatic and flexible conversation about this constitution shaped colonial law: the development of the legal profession; the place of English law in the colonies; the existence of equity courts and legislative equitable relief; property rights for women and inheritance laws; commercial law and currency reform; and laws governing religious establishment. Using as a case study the corporate colony of Rhode Island, which had the largest number of appeals of any mainland colony to the English Privy Council, she reconstructs a largely unknown world of pre-Constitutional legal culture.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PhOQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Archaeology of Anxiety,Galina Rylkova,History,,,"The ""Silver Age"" (c. 1890-1917) has been one of the most intensely studied topics in Russian literary studies, and for years scholars have been struggling with its precise definition. Firmly established in the Russian cultural psyche, it continues to influence both literature and mass media. The Archaeology of Anxiety is the first extended analysis of why the Silver Age occupies such prominence in Russian collective consciousness. Galina Rylkova examines the Silver Age as a cultural construct-the byproduct of an anxiety that permeated society in reaction to the social, political, and cultural upheavals brought on by the Bolshevik Revolution, the fall of the Romanovs, the Civil War, and Stalin's Great Terror. Rylkova's astute analysis of writings by Anna Akhmatova, Vladimir Nabokov, Boris Pasternak and Victor Erofeev reveals how the construct of the Silver Age was perpetuated and ingrained. Rylkova explores not only the Silver Age's importance to Russia's cultural identity but also the sustainability of this phenomenon. In so doing, she positions the Silver Age as an essential element to Russian cultural survival.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dyZ4j7H-NPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Death embodied,"Zoë L. Devlin, Emma-Jayne Graham",Social Science,25.68 EUR,,"In April 1485, a marble sarcophagus was found on the outskirts of Rome. It contained the remains of a young Roman woman so well-preserved that she appeared to have only just died and the sarcophagus was placed on public view, attracting great crowds. Such a find reminds us of the power of the dead body to evoke in the minds of living people, be they contemporary (survivors or mourners) or distanced from the remains by time, a range of emotions and physical responses, ranging from fascination to fear, and from curiosity to disgust. Archaeological interpretations of burial remains can often suggest that the skeletons which we uncover, and therefore usually associate with past funerary practices, were what was actually deposited in graves, rather than articulated corpses. The choices made by past communities or individuals about how to cope with a dead body in all of its dynamic and constituent forms, and whether there was reason to treat it in a manner that singled it out (positively or negatively) as different from other human corpses, provide the stimulus for this volume. The nine papers provide a series of theoretically informed, but not constrained, case studies which focus predominantly on the corporeal body in death. The aims are to take account of the active presence of dynamic material bodies at the heart of funerary events and to explore the questions that might be asked about their treatment; to explore ways of putting fleshed bodies back into our discussions of burials and mortuary treatment, as well as interpreting the meaning of these activities in relation to the bodies of both deceased and survivors; and to combine the insights that body-centered analysis can produce to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of the body, living and dead, in past cultures.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1QBDCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Giants in the earth,O. E. Rølvaag,Fiction,1.99 EUR,,"In 'Giants in the Earth,' O. E. Rølvaag masterfully explores the struggles and triumphs of Norwegian immigrants in the American Midwest during the late 19th century. Through vivid imagery and rich, lyrical prose, Rølvaag delves into the lives of his characters as they wrestle with the harsh realities of frontier life, the clash of cultures, and the haunting pull of their ancestral roots. Written in a naturalistic style, the narrative immerses readers in the psychological torment and resilience of the settlers, offering a poignant reflection on identity and belonging in a rapidly changing world. O. E. Rølvaag, a Norwegian-American novelist and a significant figure in immigrant literature, draws upon his own experiences as an immigrant to inform his work. Arriving in the United States as a young man, he personally grappled with cultural dislocation, which profoundly shaped his perspective and narrative voice. Rølvaag's deep understanding of the immigrant experience allows him to authentically portray the emotional complexities faced by his characters, making their struggles resonate on a universal level. Recommended for readers interested in the themes of migration, identity, and cultural conflict, 'Giants in the Earth' serves as both a historical account and a timeless exploration of the human spirit. Rølvaag's nuanced portrayal of resilience in the face of adversity will captivate those who appreciate rich storytelling and the exploration of cultural heritage.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YAVdEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

What is moving about this novel is its embrace of what has always driven Kundera, the delicate state of living between being and nothingness.”— Boston Globe From the internationally acclaimed, bestselling author of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, an entertaining and enchanting novel—""a fitting capstone on an extraordinary career."" (Slate) Casting light on the most serious of problems and at the same time saying not one serious sentence; being fascinated by the reality of the contemporary world and at the same time completely avoiding realism—that’s The Festival of Insignificance. Readers who know Milan Kundera’s earlier books know that the wish to incorporate an element of the “unserious” in a novel is not at all unexpected of him. In Immortality, Goethe and Hemingway stroll through several chapters together talking and laughing. And in Slowness, Vera, the author’s wife, says to her husband: “you’ve often told me you meant to write a book one day that would have not a single serious word in it…I warn you: watch out. Your enemies are lying in wait.” Kundera is finally and fully realizing his old aesthetic dream in this novel that we could easily view as a summation of his whole work. A strange sort of summation. Strange sort of epilogue. Strange sort of laughter, inspired by our time, which is comical because it has lost all sense of humor. What more can we say? Nothing.

The Physics of Submicron Structures,Harold L.

The papers in this volume, however, have been influenced to no lesser extent by the advent of molecular beam epitaxy and metal/organic chemical vapor deposition which has made possible the control of semiconductor boundaries on a quantum level. This new control of boundary condi tions in ultra small electronic research is the mathematical reason for a whole set of innovative ideas. For the first time in the history of semiconductors, it is possible to design device functions from physical considerations involving ~ngstom scale dimensions. At the time the meeting was held, July 1982, it was one of the first strong signals of the powerful developments in this area. During the meeting, important questions have been answered concerning ballistic transport, Monte Carlo simulations of high field transport and other developments pertinent to new device concepts and the understanding of small devices from physics to function.

Fate alone saw the meaning of the web it wove, the mightof it, and its place in the making of a world's history. Men thought but little of either web orweaving, calling them by other names and lighter ones, for the time unconscious of the strength ofthe thread thrown across thousands of miles of leaping, heaving, grey or blue ocean.Fate and Life planned the weaving, and it seemed mere circumstance which guided the Shuttle toand fro between two worlds divided by a gulf broader and deeper than the thousands of miles ofsalt, fierce sea-the gulf of a bitter quarrel deepened by hatred and the shedding of brothers' blood.Between the two worlds of East and West there was no will to draw nearer. Each held apart. Thosewho had rebelled against that which their souls called tyranny, having struggled madly and shedblood in tearing themselves free, turned stern backs upon their unconquered enemies, broke allcords that bound them to the past, flinging off ties of name, kinship and rank, beginning with fiercedisdain a new life.Those who, being rebelled against, found the rebels too passionate in their determination and toodesperate in their defence of their strongholds to be less than unconquerable, sailed back haughtilyto the world which seemed so far the greater power. Plunging into new battles, they added newconquests and splendour to their land, looking back with something of contempt to the half-savageWest left to build its own civilisation without other aid than the strength of its own strong righthand and strong uncultured brain.But while the two worlds held apart, the Shuttle, weaving slowly in the great hand of Fate, drewthem closer and held them firm, each of them all unknowing for many a year, that what had at firstbeen mere threads of gossamer, was forming a web whose strength in time none could compute, whose severance could be accomplished but by tragedy and convulsion",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RxpCzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
