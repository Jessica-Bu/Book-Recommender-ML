Island Stories,David Reynolds,History,,,"This history of Britain set in a global context for our times offers a new perspective on how the rise and fall of an empire shaped modern European politics. When the British voted to leave the European Union in 2016, the country's future was thrown into doubt. So, too, was its past. The story of British history is no longer a triumphalist narrative of expanding global empire, nor one of ever-closer integration with Europe. What is it now? In Island Stories, historian David Reynolds offers a multi-faceted new account of the last millennium to make sense of Britain's turbulent present. With sharp analysis and vivid human detail, he examines how fears of decline have shaped national identity, probes Britain's changing relations with Europe, considers the creation and erosion of the ""United Kingdom,"" and reassesses the rise and fall of the British Empire. Island Stories is essential reading for anyone interested in global history and politics in the era of Brexit.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I1aUyAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Methodology in Sports History,"Wray Vamplew, Dave Day",Sports & Recreation,53.49 EUR,,"The process of converting the ‘past’ into ‘history’ involves engagement with a multitude of different sources and methods, and sports historians inevitably participate in the same debates over approaches and methodologies as their counterparts in other historical disciplines. At its heart, history remains a genre of empirical knowledge that is based upon the remains of the past, and without suitable evidence, there can be no sports history. A burgeoning range of sources has stimulated new ways of thinking and a significant expansion in the sports historian’s evidentiary base, as textual sources have been supplemented by photos, films and cartoons, uniforms, architecture, maps and landscapes, and material culture more generally. This book deals with some of these innovations. It is divided into two sections, the first offering chapter-length studies of particular methodologies, and the second, brief responses from experts in their fields to the question ‘what can sports historians learn from other disciplines?’",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PjSoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
From Grand Duchy to Modern State,"Osmo Jussila, Seppo Hentilä, Jukka Nevakivi",History,,,"In this book historians Osmo Jussila, Seppo Hentilä, and Jukka Nevakivi cover the three periods of Finland's history since 1809. Their fast-moving narrative style brings to life the interaction of social and political forces and powerful personalities in a country whose destiny has been determined by its geopolitical situation between Eastern and Western Europe. From the twelfth to the early nineteenth century, Finland was ruled by Sweden, which bequeathed to it Western-style political, economic, and cultural institutions. From 1809 to the Bolshevik Revolution, it was an autonomous Grand Duchy within the Russian Empire with its own parliament, army, and currency. The Finns won their independence in 1917 but had to fight two wars against the Soviets?the Winter War of 1939?40 and the so-called Continuation War of 1941?44?to maintain their freedom. The Cold War presented further challenges as Finland sought to balance its position within the Soviet sphere of influence without succumbing to communist dictatorship. This balancing act was successfully achieved by adroit diplomatic and economic means, with Finland acting as a bridgehead between East and West in both spheres. In the 1960s and 1970s, the country achieved a high level of economic and social development supported by an extensive welfare state and in 1995 voted to join the European Union.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lbu8QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

"History of Friedrich the Second, Called Frederick the Great ...",Thomas Carlyle,,,,,
From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences,David Cahan,History,,3,"During the nineteenth century, much of the modern scientific enterprise took shape: scientific disciplines were formed, institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred. In this book, eleven leading historians of science assess what their field has taught us about this exciting time and identify issues that remain unexamined or require reconsideration. They treat both scientific disciplines—biology, physics, chemistry, the earth sciences, mathematics, and the social sciences—in their specific intellectual and sociocultural contexts as well as the broader topics of science and medicine; science and religion; scientific institutions and communities; and science, technology, and industry. Providing a much-needed overview and analysis of a rapidly expanding field, From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences will be essential for historians of science, but also of great interest to scholars of all aspects of nineteenth-century life and culture.

A Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities,Anthony Kaldellis,History,8.22 EUR,,"Weird, decadent, degenerate, racially mixed, superstitious, theocratic, effeminate, and even hyper-literate, Byzantium has long been regarded by many as one big curiosity. According to Voltaire, it represented ""a worthless collection of miracles, a disgrace for the human mind""; for Hegel, it was ""a disgusting picture of imbecility."" A Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities will churn up these old prejudices, while also stimulating a deeper interest among readers in one of history's most interesting civilizations. Many of the zanier tales and trivia that are collected here revolve around the political and religious life of Byzantium. Thus, stories of saints, relics, and their miracles-from the hilarious to the revolting-abound. Byzantine bureaucracy (whence the adjective ""Byzantine""), court scandals, and elaborate penal code are world famous. And what would Byzantium be without its eunuchs, whose ambiguous gender produced odd and risible outcomes in different contexts? The book also contains sections on daily life that are equally eye-opening, including food (from aphrodisiacs to fermented fish sauce), games such as polo and acrobatics, and obnoxious views of foreigners and others (e.g., Germans, Catholics, Arabs, dwarves). But lest we overlook Byzantium's more honorable contributions to civilization, also included are some of the marvels of Byzantine science and technology, from the military (flamethrowers and hand grenades) to the theatrical (""elevator"" thrones, roaring mechanical lions) and medical (catheters and cures, some bizarre). This vast assortment of historical anomaly and absurdity sheds vital light on one of history's most obscure and orthodox empires.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXQzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

My Desire for History,Allan Bérubé,Social Science,,,"This anthology pays tribute to Allan Berube (1946-2007), a self-taught historian and MacArthur Fellow who was a pioneer in the study of lesbian and gay history in the United States. Best known for his Lambda Literary Award-winning book Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II (1990), Berube also wrote extensively on the history of sexual politics in San Francisco and on the relationship between sexuality, class, and race. John D'Emilio and Estelle Freedman, who were close colleagues and friends of Berube, have selected sixteen of his most important essays, including hard-to-access articles and unpublished writing. The book provides a retrospective on Berube's life and work while it documents the emergence of a grassroots lesbian and gay community history movement in the 1970s and 1980s.

"Archive, Slow Ideology and Egodocuments as Microhistorical Autobiography",Sigurður Gylfi Magnússon,History,29.95 EUR,,"This book aims to demonstrate how scholars in recent times have been utilizing egodocuments from various angles and providing an opening for the multivocality of the sources to be fully appreciated. The first part of the book is concerned with the significance of egodocuments, both for the individual him/herself who creates such documents, and also for the other, who receives them. The author approaches the subject on the basis of his own personal experience, and goes on to discuss the importance of such documents for the academic world, emphasizing more general questions and issues within the fields of historiography, philosophy of history, microhistory, and memory studies. The second part of the book is based upon a photographic collection – an archive – that belonged to the author’s grandfather, who over decades accumulated photographs of vagabonds and outsiders. This part seeks to explore what kind of knowledge can be applied when a single source – an archive, document, letter, illustration, etc. – is examined, and whether the knowledge derived may not be quite as good in its own context as in the broader perspective.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3l5CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
A History of Energy Flows,Anthony N. Penna,Nature,56.7 EUR,,"This book presents a global and historical perspective of energy flows during the last millennium. The search for sustainable energy is a key issue dominating today’s energy regime. This book details the historical evolution of energy, following the overlapping and slow flowing transitions from one regime to another. In doing so it seeks to provide insight into future energy transitions and the means of utilizing sustainable energy sources to reduce humanity’s fossil fuel footprint. The book begins with an examination of the earliest and most basic forms of energy use, namely, that of humans metabolizing food in order to work, with the first transition following the domestication and breeding of horses and other animals. The book also examines energy sources key to development during the industrialization and mechanization, such as wood and coal, as well as more recent sources, such as crude oil and nuclear energy. The book then assesses energy flows that are at the forefront of sustainability, by examining green sources, such as solar, wind power and hydropower. While it is easy to see energy flows in terms of “revolutions,” transitions have taken centuries to evolve, and transitions are never fully global, as, for example, wood remains the primary fuel source for cooking in much of the developing world. This book not only demonstrates the longevity of energy transitions but also discusses the possibility for reducing transition times when technological developments provide inexpensive and safe energy sources that can reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of energy transitions, sustainable energy and environmental and energy history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gMyxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Origins of Nationalism,Caspar Hirschi,HISTORY,,,"""In this wide-ranging work, Caspar Hirschi offers new perspectives on the origins of nationalism and the formation of European nations. Based on extensive study of written and visual sources dating from the ancient to the early modern period, the author re-integrates the history of pre-modern Europe into the study of nationalism, describing it as an unintended and unavoidable consequence of the legacy of Roman imperialism in the Middle Ages. Hirschi identifies the earliest nationalists among Renaissance humanists, exploring their public roles and ambitions to offer new insight into the history of political scholarship in Europe and arguing that their adoption of ancient role models produced massive contradictions between their self-image and political function. This book demonstrates that only through understanding the development of the politics, scholarship and art of pre-modern Europe can we fully grasp the global power of nationalism in a modern political context""--",

A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty. By: Washington Irving and By: Diedrich Knickerbocker,"Washington Irving, Diedrich Knickerbocker",,,,"Diedrich Knickerbocker, persona invented by American writer Washington Irving to narrate the burlesque A History of New York (1809). An eccentric 25-year-old scholar, Knickerbocker relates this comic history of Dutch settlers in the American colony of New Amsterdam, satirizing Dutch-American mannerisms and retelling Dutch legends. Knickerbocker also narrates Irving's story Rip Van Winkle. The word Knickerbocker became synonymous with Dutch Americans in New York state and, later, with all residents of the state. The word also came to describe the knee breeches that characters wore in the original illustrated text of A History of New York............ Washington Irving (April 3, 1783 - November 28, 1859) was an American short story writer, essayist, biographer, historian, and diplomat of the early 19th century. He is best known for his short stories ""Rip Van Winkle"" (1819) and ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" (1820), both of which appear in his collection, The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. His historical works include biographies of Oliver Goldsmith, Muhammad, and George Washington, as well as several histories of 15th-century Spain dealing with subjects such as Alhambra, Christopher Columbus, and the Moors. Irving served as the U.S. ambassador to Spain from 1842 to 1846. He made his literary debut in 1802 with a series of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. After moving to England for the family business in 1815, he achieved international fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., serialized from 1819-20. He continued to publish regularly-and almost always successfully-throughout his life, and just eight months before his death (at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York), completed a five-volume biography of George Washington. Irving, along with James Fenimore Cooper, was among the first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and Irving encouraged American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. Irving was also admired by some European writers, including Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Charles Dickens, Francis Jeffrey, and Walter Scott. Also, as the United States' first internationally best-selling author, Irving advocated for writing as a legitimate profession and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement. Washington Irving's parents were William Irving, Sr., originally of Quholm, Shapinsay, Orkney, Scotland, and Sarah (nee Sanders), both Scottish-English immigrants. They married in 1761 while William was serving as a petty officer in the British Navy. They had eleven children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Their first two sons, each named William, died in infancy, as did their fourth child, John. Their surviving children were: William, Jr. (1766), Ann (1770), Peter (1771), Catherine (1774), Ebenezer (1776), John Treat (1778), Sarah (1780), and Washington.The Irving family settled in Manhattan, New York and was part of the city's small, vibrant merchant class when Washington Irving was born on April 3, 1783, the same week New York City residents learned of the British ceasefire that ended the American Revolution; Irving's mother named him after the hero of the revolution, George Washington.At age 6, with the help of a nanny, Irving met his namesake, who was then living in New York after his inauguration as President of the United States, in 1789. The president blessed young Irving, an encounter Irving later commemorated in a small watercolor painting, which continues to hang in his home.The Irvings lived at 131 William Street at the time of Washington Irving's birth. The family later moved across the street to 128 William St. Several of Washington Irving's older brothers became active New York merchants, and they encouraged their younger brother's literary aspirations....",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yo3YswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

A more comprehensive view of the state's systemic reforms is also provided. The five goals included the following: (1) strengthen graduation requirements and provide a stronger curriculum; (2) adopt more rigorous and measurable standards and expectations; (3) devote more time to study the core curriculum; (4) enhance staff development and the teaching profession; and (5) provide effective leadership and adequate resources. Although school productivity is difficult to quantify, data indicate that progress is occurring for all categories of students. California has also been challenged by 100,000 new students that have entered schools annually since 1983, an increase in the number of limited-English speaking and economically disadvantaged students, and declines in funding. Twelve figures are included. (LMI)",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-YiI1tcvMVsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Thomas Seebohm on the Foundations of the Sciences,Thomas Nenon,Philosophy,96.29 EUR,,"This book explores the work of Thomas Seebohm (1934-2014), a leading phenomenologist and hermeneuticist. It features papers that offer a critical and constructive dialogue about Seebohm’s analyses and their implications for the sciences. The net result is an in-depth study and a helpful overview of Seebohm’s general approach and his specific views on various areas of modern science. The contributors focus especially upon his final text, History as a Science and the System of the Sciences. They view this as the culmination and summary of his historical and phenomenological investigations into the foundations, nature, and limits of modern sciences. This includes not just history but the Geisteswissenschaften more generally, along with the social and natural sciences as well. The essays in this volume reflect that range. This volume presents insightful discussions about the nature and legitimacy of the human sciences as sciences and the unique character of the social sciences. It will be of interest not just as a matter of historical scholarship, but also and above all as an important contribution to phenomenology and to the philosophy of science and the sciences as such. It deserves attention by scholars from any philosophical tradition interested in thinking about the foundations of their disciplines and a philosophy of science that includes, but is not limited to, the natural sciences.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p0fODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Code was first published in 1926, and a new edition of the code has been published every six years since 1934. The 2012 edition of the Code incorporates laws enacted through the One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second Session, the last of which was signed by the President on January 15, 2013. It does not include laws of the One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First Session, enacted between January 2, 2013, the date it convened, and January 15, 2013. By statutory authority this edition may be cited ""U.S.C. 2012 ed."" As adopted in 1926, the Code established prima facie the general and permanent laws of the United States. The underlying statutes reprinted in the Code remained in effect and controlled over the Code in case of any discrepancy. In 1947, Congress began enacting individual titles of the Code into positive law. When a title is enacted into positive law, the underlying statutes are repealed and the title then becomes legal evidence of the law. Currently, 26 of the 51 titles in the Code have been so enacted. These are identified in the table of titles near the beginning of each volume. The Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives continues to prepare legislation pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 285b to enact the remainder of the Code, on a title-by-title basis, into positive law. The 2012 edition of the Code was prepared and published under the supervision of Ralph V. Seep, Law Revision Counsel. Grateful acknowledgment is made of the contributions by all who helped in this work, particularly the staffs of the Office of the Law Revision Counsel and the Government Printing Office""--Preface.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CrfFgIDRJLQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Reasonable Children,Michael S. Pritchard,Education,,,"The public outcry for a return to moral education in our schools has raised more dust than it's dispelled. Building upon his provocative ideas in On Becoming Responsible, Michael Pritchard clears the air with a sensible plan for promoting our children's moral education through the teaching of reasonableness. Pritchard contends that children have a definite but frequently untapped capacity for reasonableness and that schools in a democratic society must make the nurturing of that capacity one of their primary aims, as fundamental to learning as the development of reading, writing, and math skills. Reasonableness itself, he shows, can be best cultivated through the practice of philosophical inquiry within a classroom community. In such an environment, children learn to work together, to listen to one another, to build on one another's ideas, to probe assumptions and different perspectives, and ultimately to think for themselves. Advocating approaches to moral education that avoid mindless indoctrination and timid relativism, Pritchard neither preaches nor hides behind abstractions. He makes liberal use of actual classroom dialogues to illustrate children's remarkable capacity to engage in reasonable conversation about moral concepts involving fairness, cheating, loyalty, truthtelling, lying, making and keeping promises, obedience, character, and responsibility. He also links such discussions to fundamental concerns over law and moral authority, the roles of teachers and parents, and the relationship between church and state. Pritchard draws broadly and deeply from the fields of philosophy and psychology, as well as from his own extensive personal experience working with children and teachers. The result is a rich and insightful work that provides real hope for the future of our children and their moral education.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9BieAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

"A History of International Monetary Diplomacy, 1867 to the Present",Giulio M. Gallarotti,Business & Economics,51.35 EUR,,"This book is about how the rise of democracy has transformed economics over the past 150 years. As voting was expanded to the masses in the late 19th century, political leaders faced emergent pressures to deliver prosperity to their newly enfranchised populations. This led to the rise of the guardian state: a state whose prime directive was to protect economic growth and employment. Domestic economic goals now became sacrosanct, and if that meant a failure on the international stage to construct solutions to problems in monetary relations, so be it. The book traces the history of international monetary diplomacy during this long period to show how the guardian state has manifested itself, and how it has shaped the course of international monetary relations. Each of the most important international monetary conferences in history is scrutinized with respect to how nations sought to protect the prosperity within their national economies. The historical narratives give a bird’s-eye view into how domestic political priorities have intruded on and shaped economic relations among nations. The book clearly demonstrates the advantages of an interdisciplinary understanding of how politics shapes economics. It will be invaluable reading for scholars and students of international economics, politics and economic history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5gwxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A History of Modern Librarianship,"Pamela Spence Richards, Wayne A. Wiegand, Marija Dalbello",Language Arts & Disciplines,59.17 EUR,,"A broad, comparative history of librarianship, this intriguing work goes beyond the standard focus on institutions and collections to help you explore the part modern librarianship played—and continues to play—in forming Western cultures. Previous histories of libraries in the Western world—the last of which was published nearly 20 years ago—concentrate on libraries and librarians. This book takes a different approach. It focuses on the practice of librarianship, showing you how that practice has contributed to constructing the heritage of cultures. To do so, this groundbreaking collection of essays presents the history of modern librarianship in the context of recent developments of the library institution, professionalization of librarianship, and innovation through information technology. Organized by region, the book addresses the widely recognized, international impact of Anglo-American librarianship and its continuing influence over the past century, combining critical analysis with chronological histories of modern librarianship in Europe, North America, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa. An introductory chapter explains the origins of the project, and a concluding chapter examines the effects of digitization on modern librarianship in the 21st century.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9orDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Bolles carefully structures the text to help readers understand what science is, the contribution by gestaltists, and the value of applied psychology. Emphasizing key participants such as Wundt, James, Hall, and Watson, Bolles also presents certain key themes--philosophical principles such as atomism, mechanism, empiricism, and associationism; and shows students that these themes have come and gone over the years. Bolles also mentions psychologists in a context of famous historical personalities, helping readers get a sense of the everyday world of each psychologist.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pvtGAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
A History of American Literature Since 1870,Fred Lewis Pattee,Literary Collections,,,"Excerpt from A History of American Literature Since 1870 American literature in the larger sense of the term began with Irving, and, if we count The Sketch Book as the beginning, the centennial year of its birth is yet four years hence. It has been a custom, especially among the writers of text-books, to divide this century into periods, and all have agreed at one point: in the mid-thirties undoubtedly there began a new and distinct literary movement. The names given to this new age, which corresponded in a general way with the Victorian Era in England, have been various. It has been called the Age of Emerson, the Transcendental Period, the National Period, the Central Period. National it certainly was not, but among the other names there is little choice. Just as with the Victorian Era in England, not much has been said as to when the period ended. There has been no official closing, though it has been long evident that all the forces that brought it about have long since expended themselves and that a distinctively new period has not only begun but has already quite run its course. It has been our object to determine this new period and to study its distinguishing characteristics. We have divided the literary history of the century into three periods, denominating them as the Knickerbocker Period, the New England Period, and the National Period, and we have made the last to begin shortly after the close of the Civil War with those new forces and new ideals and broadened views that grew out of that mighty struggle. The field is a new one: no other book and no chapter of a book has ever attempted to handle it as a unit. It is an important one: it is our first really national period, all-American, autochthonic. It was not until after the war that our writers ceased to imitate and looked to their own land for material and inspiration. The amount of its literary product has been amazing. There have been single years in which have been turned out more volumes than were produced during all of the Knickerbocker Period. The quality of this output has been uniformly high.

Studying Singapore's Past,"Ping Tjin Thum, Karl Hack, Kevin Blackburn, John Bastin, Anthony Milner, Kelvin W.K. Ng, A.J. Stockwell, Jason Lim",History,,,"C.M. (Mary) Turnbull's contributions to historical writing on Singapore extended from her 1962 thesis, published in 1972 as ""The Straits Settlements, 1826-1867: Indian Presidency to Crown Colony"", to her magisterial history of Singapore, first published in 1977 and re-issued in 2009 in an updated edition as A History of Singapore, 1819-2005. Her approach to history involved detailed work with documents and published materials, with a particular focus on political and economic history. One contributor to the present volume described the book as an ""exercise in endowing a modern 'nation-state' with a coherent past that should explain the present."" As styles in history evolved, younger scholars including some of her former students and colleagues began exploring new approaches to historical research that drew on non-English-language souce material and asked fresh questions of the sources. Mary enjoyed controversy and expected debate, and had a deep interest in these accounts, which were in many ways a natural progression from her own publications even when they raised questions about her interpretations and conclusions. Studying Singapore's Past had its origins in a conference organised to discuss her work. The volume includes ten contributions, some from long-established scholars of Singapore's history, others from a new generation of researchers. Their work offers an evaluation of established understandings of Singapore's history, and gives an indication of new directions that researchers are exploring. In publishing the book, the editor not only pays tribute to a distinguished historian but also seeks to make a contribution to the historiography of Singapore and to ongoing debates about Singapore's past.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ho0sCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
The History of American Homeopathy,John S Haller,Medical,,,"Although scorned in the early 1900s and publicly condemned by Abraham Flexner and the American Medical Association, the practice of homeopathy did not disappear. Instead, it evolved with the emergence of holistic healing and Eastern philosophy in the United States and today is a form of alternative medicine practiced by more than 100,000 physicians worldwide and used by millions of people to treat everyday ailments as well as acute and chronic diseases. The History of American Homeopathy traces the rise of lay practitioners in shaping homeopathy as a healing system and its relationship to other forms of complementary and alternative medicine in an age when conventional biomedicine remains the dominant form. Representing the most current and up-to-date history of American homeopathy, readers will benefit from John S.

History of New Zealand,History and Civilization Collection,History,4.49 EUR,,"This book presents the History of New Zealand : the ""Land of the Long White Cloud"". New Zealand is an Island country of the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The date of man's arrival in New Zealand is uncertain. All that can be safely asserted is that by the 14th century A.D. Polynesian canoe-men had reached its northern shores in successive voyages. By 1642 they had spread to South Island, for there Abel Jansen Tasman found them when, in the course of his circuitous voyage from Java in the “Heemskirk,” he chanced upon the archipelago, coasted along much of its western side, though without venturing to land, and gave it the name it still bears. One hundred and thirty-seven years later, Cook, in the barque “Endeavour,” gained a much fuller knowledge of the coasts, which he circumnavigated, visited again and again, and mapped out with fair accuracy. He annexed the country, but the British government disavowed the act. After him came other navigators, French, Spanish, Russian and American; and, as the 18th century neared its end, came sealers, whalers and trading-schooners in quest of flax and timber. English missionaries, headed by Samuel Marsden, landed in 1814, to make for many years but slow progress...",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NkMxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
By the Sword,Richard Cohen,History,12.26 EUR,,"“Like swordplay itself, By the Sword is elegant, accurate, romantic, and full of brio—the definitive study, hugely readable, of man’s most deadly art.”—Simon Winchester With a new Preface by the author Napoleon fenced. So did Shakespeare, Karl Marx, Grace Kelly, and President Truman, who as a schoolboy would practice fencing with Bess—his future wife— when the two of them returned home from school. Lincoln was a canny dueler. Ignatius Loyola challenged a man to a duel for denying Christ’s divinity (and won). Less successful, but no less enthusiastic, was Mussolini, who would tell his wife he was “off to get spaghetti,” their code to avoid alarming the children. By the Sword is an epic history of sword fighting—a science, an art, and, for many, a religion that began at the dawn of civilization in ancient Egypt and has been an obsession for mankind ever since. With wit and insight, Richard Cohen gives us an engrossing history of the world via the sword. Praise for By the Sword “Touché! While scrupulous and informed about its subject, Richard Cohen’s book is about more than swordplay. It reads at times like an alternative social history of the West.”—Sebastian Faulks “In writing By the Sword, [Cohen] has shown that he is as skilled with the pen as he is with the sword.”—The New York Times “Irresistible . . . extraordinary . . . vivid and hugely enjoyable.”—The Economist “A virtual encyclopedia on the subject of sword fighting.”—San Francisco Chronicle “Literate, learned, and, beg pardon, razor-sharp . . . a pleasure for practitioners, and a rewarding entertainment for the armchair swashbuckler.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=inND87EFFF4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A shrewd and discerning storyteller, Schwartz captures history from her vantage as a child of German-Jewish immigrants, a wife of over fifty years, a breast cancer survivor, a working mother, a traveler, a tennis player, a daughter, and a widow.

The approach taken is both thematic, with chapters on the underlying determinants of economic performance, and chronological, with coverage of the whole of the Greek and Roman worlds extending from the Aegean Bronze Age to Late Antiquity. The contributors move beyond the substantivist-formalist debates that dominated twentieth-century scholarship and display a new interest in economic growth in antiquity. New methods for measuring economic development are explored, often combining textual and archaeological data that have previously been treated separately.

With contributions from leading historians in the field, Volume 5, Part Two paints a complex portrait of a dynasty beset by problems and contradictions, but one which, despite its military and geopolitical weakness, was nevertheless economically powerful, culturally brilliant, socially fluid and the most populous of any empire in global history to that point. In this much anticipated addition to the series, the authors survey key themes across ten chapters, including government, economy, society, religion, and thought to provide an authoritative and topical treatment of a profound and significant period in Chinese history.",

Fallen Glory,James Crawford,Architecture,,,"“A narrative that spans seven millennia, five continents and even reaches into cyberspace. . . . I savored each page.” —Henry Petroski, Wall Street Journal In Fallen Glory, James Crawford uncovers the biographies of some of the world’s most fascinating lost and ruined buildings, from the dawn of civilization to the cyber era. The lives of these iconic structures are packed with drama and intrigue, featuring war and religion, politics and art, love and betrayal, catastrophe and hope. They provide the stage for a startling array of characters, including Gilgamesh, the Cretan Minotaur, Agamemnon, Nefertiti, Genghis Khan, Henry VIII, Catherine the Great, Adolf Hitler, and even Bruce Springsteen. The twenty-one structures Crawford focuses on include The Tower of Babel, The Temple of Jerusalem, The Library of Alexandria, The Bastille, Kowloon Walled City, the Berlin Wall, and the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Ranging from the deserts of Iraq, the banks of the Nile and the cloud forests of Peru, to the great cities of Jerusalem, Istanbul, Paris, Rome, London and New York, Fallen Glory is a unique guide to a world of vanished architecture. And, by picking through the fragments of our past, it asks what history’s scattered ruins can tell us about our own future. “Witty and memorable . . . moving as well as myth-busting.” —Times Literary Supplement (UK) “[An] elegant, charged book . . . A well-written prize for students of history, archaeology, and urban planning.” —Kirkus Reviews, starred review “Astute, entertaining, and affecting.” —Booklist “A lovely, wise book.” —Alexander McCall Smith, New Statesman (UK) “A cabinet of curiosities, a book of wonders with unexpected excursions and jubilant and haunting marginalia.” —Spectator (UK)",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T8TVCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
A History of the Spanish Lexicon,Steven N. Dworkin,Language Arts & Disciplines,73.39 EUR,,"This history of the Spanish lexicon is written from the interacting perspectives of linguistic and cultural change and in the light of advances in the study of language contact and lexical change. The author describes the language inherited from spoken Latin in the Iberian Peninsula during six centuries of Roman occupation and examines the degree to which it imported words from the languages - of which only Basque survives - of pre-Roman Spain. He then shows how Germanic words were imported either indirectly through Latin or Old French or directly by contact with the Visigoths. He describes the importation of Arabisms following the eighth-century Arab conquest of Spain, distinguishing those documented in medieval sources from those adopted for everyday use, many of which survive in modern Spanish. He considers the influence of Old French and Old Provençal and identifies late direct and indirect borrowings from Latin, including the Italian elements taken up during the Renaissance. After outlining minor influences from languages such as Flemish, Portuguese, and Catalan, Professor Dworkin examines the effects on the lexicon of contact between Spanish and the indigenous languages of South and Central America, and the impact of contact with English. The book is aimed at advanced students and scholars of Spanish linguistics and will interest specialists in Hispanic literary and cultural studies.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LQJREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

"Real Estate Investment Trust Performance, Efficiency and Internationalization",Joshua A. Harris,,,,"Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are firms that own and manage income producing commercial real estate for the benefit of their shareholders. The three studies in this dissertation explore topics relating to best practices of REIT management and portfolio composition. Managers and investors can use the findings herein to aide in analyzing a REIT's performance and determining optimal investment policies. Utilizing REIT from SNL Real Estate and CRSP, the first two studies examine the role of international diversification upon performance, technical efficiency, and scale efficiency. The third study utilizes REIT data to examine technical and scale efficiency over a 21 year window and investigates characteristics of the REITs that affect the levels of efficiency. CHAPTER 1--PROFITABILITY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST INTERNATIONALIZATION Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the United States have grown extremely fast in terms of assets and market capitalization since the early 1990's. As with many industries, U.S. REITs began acquiring foreign properties as their size grew and they needed to seek new investment opportunities. This paper investigates the role of holding foreign assets upon the total return of U.S. based REITs from 1995 through 2010. We find that holding foreign properties in associated with negative relative performance when risk, size, and other common market factors are controlled for. Interestingly, the source of the negative performance is not related to the two largest areas for foreign investment, Europe and Canada. Instead, the negative performance is detected when a REIT begins acquiring properties in other global regions such as Latin America and Asia/Pacific. This paper has broad ramifications for REIT investors and managers alike. CHAPTER 2--EFFECT OF INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION BY U.S. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS ON COST EFFICIENCY AND SCALE As U.S. based Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have increased their degree and type of holdings overseas, there has yet to a study that has investigated such activity on the REIT's measures of cost efficiency and scale. Using data from 2010, Data Envelopment Analysis techniques are used to estimate measures of technical and scale efficiency that are then regressed against measures of international diversification and other controls to measure the impact of this global expansion. It is determined that REITs with foreign holdings are significantly larger than domestic REITs and are correspondingly 96% of foreign investing REITs are operating at decreasing returns to scale. Further almost every measure of foreign diversification is negative and significantly impacting scale efficiency. However, simply being a REIT with foreign holdings did positively and significantly associate with higher levels of technical efficiencies. Thus REITs that expand globally may have some advantages in operational efficiency but lose considerably in terms of scale efficiency by increasing their size as they move cross-border. CHAPTER 3--THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to measure technical and scale efficiency of 21 years of Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) data. This is the longest, most complete dataset ever analyzed in the REIT efficiency literature and as such makes a significant contribution as prior efficiency studies' data windows end in the early 2000's at latest. Overall, REITs appear to continue to operate at decreasing returns to scale despite rapid growth in total assets. Further, there is some evidence of improving technical efficiency overtime; however the finding is not strong. In summation, it appears that REITs have not improved on a relative basis despite the rapid growth, a finding that suggests a potential of a high degree of firm competition in the REIT industry. Finally, firm characteristics such as debt utilization, management and advisory structure, and property type specialization are tested for their impact upon technical and scale efficiency.",

Framing an Agricultural Future Informed by History,Oak A. Hawk,Agricultural ecology,,,"The impact on farming from the transformation of the US food system over the last century marks a fundamental disruption in the country’s path of agricultural development. Considering increasing evidence of pernicious environmental and social effects resulting from industrialized practices, substantial strides have been made to develop alternative methods, but structural and cultural obstacles impede their widespread adoption. By placing late 19th and early 20th century agricultural publications within the context of agroecology, it is possible to weave a thread through history that reconnects with the previous path of development. This connection can help build a foundation for sustainable transition of family farms in the Midwest. By distilling the principles and practices common to pre-industrial and sustainable farming into a guidebook, this project makes them highly accessible. Implementing these principles and practices could mitigate negative environmental impacts of agriculture, revitalize rural communities through the development of vibrant agricultural economies, and contribute to the development of a sustainable and resilient agricultural future in the Midwest.",

"Haggett, Peter",Trevor J. Barnes,Economics,,,"Peter Haggett (1933-) is arguably the most well known of the ""quantitative revolutionaries"" within human geography. During the first part of the 1960s, he, along with others, transformed the discipline into a science, spatial science, or as it was also called, the ""new geography."" After his contribution, human geography was utterly different. How it looked on the page, how it was written, what skills were needed, what counted as good geographical work, and who was deemed a capable geographer were all fundamentally altered. Before Haggett, human geography was defined by the descriptive study of unique regions. Under a given geographical typology (e.g., ""relief,"" ""climate,"" ""major cities,"" and ""transportation systems""), the facts of a region were painstakingly gathered, collated, and illustrated with maps and black-and-white photos. ...",

[W]ith lush and insightful prose . . . a foreign landscape and culture becomes warm and familiar.” —Amy Sue Nathan, author of The Good Neighbor and The Glass Wives It’s 2006 in a seaside village in Israel, where a war is brewing. Lauren, Emily, Aviva and Rachel, four memorable women from different backgrounds, are living abroad in the coastal town. Lauren, a maternity nurse, loves her Israeli doctor husband but struggles to make a home for herself in a foreign land miles away from her beloved Boston. Seeking a fresh start after divorce, her vivacious friend Emily follows. Strong, sensuous Aviva, brought to Israel years earlier by intelligence work, has raised a family and now lost a son. And Rachel, a beautiful, idealistic college graduate from Wyoming, arrives with her hopeful dreams. The women forge a friendship that sustains them as they come to terms with love and loss, and the outbreak of war. Their intimate bond is strengthened by their participation in a traditional ritual that closes the circle of life. As their lives are slowly transformed, each finds unexpected strength and resilience.

Adventure Games,"Aaron A. Reed, John Murray, Anastasia Salter",Games & Activities,,,"The genre of adventure games is frequently overlooked. Lacking the constantly-evolving graphics and graphic violence of their counterparts in first-person and third-person shooters or role-playing games, they are often marketed to and beloved by players outside of mainstream game communities. While often forgotten by both the industry and academia, adventure games have had (and continue to have) a surprisingly wide influence on contemporary games, in categories including walking simulators, hidden object games, visual novels, and bestselling titles from companies like Telltale and Campo Santo. In this examination of heirs to the genre's legacy, the authors examine the genre from multiple perspectives, connecting technical analysis with critical commentary and social context. This will be the first book to consider this important genre from a comprehensive and transdisciplinary perspective. Drawing upon methods from platform studies, software studies, media studies, and literary studies, they reveal the genre's ludic and narrative origins and patterns, where character (and the player's embodiment of a character) is essential to the experience of play and the choices within a game. A deep structural analysis of adventure games also uncovers an unsteady balance between sometimes contradictory elements of story, exploration, and puzzles: with different games and creators employing a multitude of different solutions to resolving this tension.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NrzPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Estimation of quantiles in a simulation model based on artificial neural networks,Sevda Alaca,Mathematics,29.99 EUR,,"Master's Thesis from the year 2017 in the subject Mathematics - Stochastics, grade: 1,3, Technical University of Darmstadt, language: English, abstract: This thesis deals with the development of an ""alpha""-quantile estimate based on a surrogate model with the use of artificial neural networks. Using artificial neural networks as an estimate is considered a nonparametric approach. The estimation of a specific quantile of a data population is a widely used statistical task and a comprehensive way to discover the true relationship among variables. It can be classified as nonparametric regression, where it is one of the standard tasks. The most common selected levels for estimation are the first, second and third quartile (25, 50 and 75 percent). The quantile level is given by ""alpha"". A 25 percent quantile for example has 25 percent of the data distribution below the named quantile and 75 percent of the data distribution above it. Sometimes the tail regions of a population characteristic are of interest rather than the core of the distribution. Quantile estimation is applied in many different contexts - financial economics, survival analysis and environmental modelling are only a few of them.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FrgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Lost Valley of Iskander,Robert E. Howard,Fiction,6.41 EUR,,"This early work by Robert E. Howard was originally published in the 20th century and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. 'The Lost Valley of Iskander' is a story in the El Borak series where El Borak discovers the Greek descendants of Alexander the Great. Robert Ervin Howard was born in Peaster, Texas in 1906. During his youth, his family moved between a variety of Texan boomtowns, and Howard - a bookish and somewhat introverted child - was steeped in the violent myths and legends of the Old South. At fifteen Howard began to read the pulp magazines of the day, and to write more seriously. The December 1922 issue of his high school newspaper featured two of his stories, 'Golden Hope Christmas' and 'West is West'. In 1924 he sold his first piece - a short caveman tale titled 'Spear and Fang' - for $16 to the not-yet-famous Weird Tales magazine. Howard's most famous character, Conan the Cimmerian, was a barbarian-turned-King during the Hyborian Age, a mythical period of some 12,000 years ago. Conan featured in seventeen Weird Tales stories between 1933 and 1936 which is why Howard is now regarded as having spawned the 'sword and sorcery' genre. The Conan stories have since been adapted many times, most famously in the series of films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0pR-CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
The Divorce Revolution,Lenore J. Weitzman,Family & Relationships,,1,"Based upon interviews with judges, lawyers, and divorced persons in California, and data collected from that state#x19;s court dockets, this volume presents the first systematic examination of the social and economic effects of divorce law reform. Sociologist Weitzman concludes that while the abolition of grounds, fault, and consent has eliminated much of the acrimony previously associated with divorce proceedings, this, together with the institution of gender-neutral standards for property awards and child support, has resulted in increased economic hardship and social dislocation for divorced women and dependent children. Weitzman does not intend to extrapolate her data, conclusions, and recommendations to the whole country; however, it is reasonable to believe that they have national implications.

Africa,John Reader,History,,,"In 1978, paleontologists in East Africa discovered the earliest evidence of our divergence from the apes: three pre-human footprints, striding away from a volcano, were preserved in the petrified surface of a mudpan over three million years ago. Out of Africa, the world's most ancient and stable landmass, Homo sapiens dispersed across the globe. And yet the continent that gave birth to human history has long been woefully misunderstood and mistreated by the rest of the world. In a book as splendid in its wealth of information as it is breathtaking in scope, British writer and photojournalist John Reader brings to light Africa's geology and evolution, the majestic array of its landforms and environments, the rich diversity of its peoples and their ways of life, the devastating legacies of slavery and colonialism as well as recent political troubles and triumphs. Written in simple, elegant prose and illustrated with Reader's own photographs, Africa: A Biography of the Continent is an unforgettable book that will delight the general reader and expert alike.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XK2OEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Cambridge Introduction to Scenography,"Joslin McKinney, Philip Butterworth",Drama,,,"Scenography - the manipulation and orchestration of the performance environment - is an increasingly popular and key area in performance studies. This book introduces the reader to the purpose, identity and scope of scenography and its theories and concepts. Settings and structures, light, projected images, sound, costumes and props are considered in relation to performing bodies, text, space and the role of the audience. Concentrating on scenographic developments in the twentieth century, the Introduction examines how these continue to evolve in the twenty-first century. Scenographic principles are clearly explained through practical examples and their theoretical context. Although acknowledging the many different ways in which design shapes the creation of scenography, the book is not exclusively concerned with the role of the theatre designer. In order to map out the wider territory and potential of scenography, the theories of pioneering scenographers are discussed alongside the work of directors, writers and visual artists.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vliatAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

When Verloc is reluctantly involved in an anarchist plot to blow up the Greenwich Observatory things go disastrously wrong, and what appears to be 'a simple tale' proves to involve politicians, policemen, foreign diplomats and London's fashionable society in the darkest and most surprising interrelations.Joseph Conrad (born Teodor Jozef Konrad Korzeniowski, 3 December 1857 - 3 August 1924) was a Polish-born novelist. Some of his works have been labelled romantic: Conrad's supposed ""romanticism"" is heavily imbued with irony and a fine sense of man's capacity for self-deception.""",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rOwHvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Lantern of the Path,Imam Ja`far Al-Sadiq,Religion,,,"IMAM JA`FAR AL-SADIQ The sixth Imam in the line of the Twelve Imams descended from the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Ja`far ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq (702-765 C.E. or 17th Rabi` al-Awwal 83 AH - 15th Shawwal 148 AH) was the founder of the Ja`fari School of Islamic Law and a renowned scholar of his age. His father was the Imam Muhammad al-Baqir and his mother, Farwa, was a great-granddaughter of Abu Bakr. He lived in Arabia in the eighth century. He devoted his attention to interpreting divine utterances and applied himself to such controversial subjects as iraadah (free will) and qadr (the power to direct one's own actions). He is regarded as one of the greatest of the imams and is also revered by the Naqshbandi Sunni Sufi chain. THE LANTERN OF THE PATH The Lantern of The Path comprises ninety-nine chapters. Each one is a threshold to the next, guiding the reader through the broad spectrum of ageless wisdom, like a lantern along the path of reality. The author illuminates the inner meanings of outer practices which range from practical everyday acts of behavior, to the practices of worship, morals and ethics, and the pillars of religion. Practical and profound, this concise volume is a useful guide for those who wish to cultivate their inner being. accompanying commentary, students and adepts alike can now gain a profounder understanding of these timeless teachings from the wellspring of the heart of Islam.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jV-4wgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Battle of Life Annotated,Charles Dickens,,,,"The Battle of Life: A Love Story is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published in 1846. It is the fourth of his five Christmas Books, coming after The Cricket on the Hearth and followed by The Haunted Man.It is noteworthy in that it is the only one out of the five books that does not have any use of supernatural elements. It bears the greatest resemblance to The Cricket on the Hearth in two aspects: that it is not a social novel and that it is resolved with a romantic twist. As is typical with Dickens, the ending is a happy one, and some might argue an overly happy one.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xHMozgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
The Iconography of Independence,"Robert Holland, Susan Williams, Terry Barringer",History,,,"This book explores the phenomenon of Independence Days. These rituals had complex meanings both in the territories concerned and in Britain as the imperial metropole, where they were extensively reported in the press. The text is concerned with the political management, associated rhetoric and iconography of these seminal celebrations. The focus is therefore very much on political culture in a broad sense, and changing perceptions and presentations over time. Highlights of the book include an overview by David Cannadine relating the topic to ornamentalism, invented tradition and transitions in British culture. Although the book is mainly concerned with the British Empire, Martin Shipway âe"" a leading historian and cultural analyst of French decolonization âe"" contributes an acute summary of how the same âe~momentâe(tm) was handled differently in the other great European empires. There are detailed and lively studies by noted specialists of the immediate coming of Independence to India/Pakistan, Malaya, Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Guyana. The book includes a thematic focus on the important role of representatives of the British monarchy in legitimating transfers of sovereignty at their point of climax. This book was published as a special issue of The Round Table.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O4SmlgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

A thousand gold-seekers were clamoring for the immediate landing of their outfits. Each hatchway gaped wide open, and from the lower depths the shrieking donkey-engines were hurrying the misassorted outfits skyward. On either side of the steamer, rows of scows received the flying cargo, and on each of these scows a sweating mob of men charged the descending slings and heaved bales and boxes about in frantic search. Men waved shipping receipts and shouted over the steamer-rails to them. Sometimes two and three identified the same article, and war arose.

The Devil Behind the Mirror,Steven Gregory,History,,,"""In his stunningly vivid picture of communities grappling with the demons of economic globalization, Gregory shows how peoples' livelihoods are devalued and torn asunder when they are exposed to the rough justice of the market. An absorbing case study and an ethnographic tour de force.""--Andrew Ross, author of Fast Boat to China: Corporate Flight and the Consequences of Free Trade ""Steven Gregory has done it again. Globalization, tourism, citizenship, gender, work, media, urban development--no topic is left untouched in this gifted and much awaited ethnography. This work is sure to illuminate and teach us much about the contemporary workings of neoliberalism and power in the Caribbean and Latin America.""--Arlene Dávila, author of Barrio Dreams: Puerto Ricans, Latinos, and the Neoliberal City ""For small countries, globalization glitters with the promise of deliverance from entrenched poverty. But in the Dominican Republic, Steven Gregory finds a crazy quilt of tourist development that fixes labor, racial, and gender inequalities in place. With wit and flair, ordinary folks mock and challenge the deceptive surfaces of globalization. Gregory has written an important account of how globalization creates hope and yet hurts people in poor countries.""--Aihwa Ong, author of Buddha Is Hiding: Refugees, Citizenship, the New America, and Neoliberalism as Exception: Mutations in Citizenship and Sovereignty ""The Devil behind the Mirror is a truly great book. Steven Gregory powerfully reveals the myriad ways in which poor--but always resourceful--people in one particular place live in, through, and against the effects of globalization. In the process, Gregory demonstrates the continuing, and indeed increasingly urgent, value of on-the-ground ethnographic research in the contemporary world. Linking global dynamics with real people's lives, the book is both brilliantly argued and beautifully written.""--Sherry B.

Bloodied Banners,Robert W. Jones,Antiques & Collectibles,,,"Groundbreaking reassessment of the role played by armour, weapons and heraldry in medieval warfare, showing their cultural as well as military significance. `A penetrating investigation of medieval martial display... The reader is struck by its originality, and by its sophisticated and critical interpretative engagement with historical and literary sources. Particularly notable is the author's subtle exploration of the function of armour: not only its practical role, but as a form of display... A refreshingly different approach to the world of the medieval combatant and his place within that ""host of many colours"" that was a medieval army, it adds a new dimension to our understanding of medieval warfare.' Dr ANDREW AYTON, Senior Lecturer in History, University of Hull The medieval battlefield was a place of spectacle and splendour. The fully-armed knight, bedecked in his vivid heraldic colours, mounted on his great charger, riding out beneath his brightly-painted banner, is a stock image of war and the warrior in the middle ages. Yet too often the significance of such display has been ignored or dismissed as the empty preening of a militaristic social elite. Drawing on a broad range of source material and using innovative historical approaches, this book completely re-evaluates the way that such men and their weapons were viewed, showing that martial display was a vital part of the way in which war was waged in the middle ages. It maintains that heraldry and livery served not only to advertise a warrior's family and social ties, but also announced his presence on the battlefield and right to wage war. It also considers the physiological and psychological effect of wearing armour, both on the wearer and those facing him in combat, arguing that the need for display in battle was deeper than any medieval cultural construct and was based in the fundamental biological drives of threat and warning.

Donovan,,,,"Excerpt from The Saleslady The S aleslady is, at any rate, a contribution to our knowl edge Of changes that are taking place in the life and charac ter of women as a result of their entrance into the broader fields of economic life. It is in manner impressionistic and descriptive rather than systematic and formal; Frances Donovan, the author, is rather more interested in the his tory than in the sociology Of contemporary life. The book she has written, because Of its exploratory character, has more the character of a personal narrative and a report of observations than of a systematic treatise. It is written, one may perhaps say, from the point of View Of what Lindeman aptly calls the participant Observer. The author has been able to enter sympathetically and understandingly into the experiences Of the persons whose lives she depicts, but at the same time she is keenly alive to the larger implications Of her own experiences and those of the women with whom she is associated.

Research Methods for the Architectural Profession,"Ajla Aksamija, Taylor & Francis Group",,,,"Research Methods for the Architectural Profession introduces research as a systematic process, describes how to formulate research questions, provides an in-depth explanation of different research methods (qualitative, quantitative, and experimental), explains how to select appropriate research methods, and execute research studies. It describes the process of documentation, knowledge dissemination, and application of research results in architectural design and practice. Most importantly, it provides guidelines for integrating research into profession, and uses extensive case-studies and practice-relevant examples to illustrate main concepts, procedures, and applications. Integrating research into practice is essential for developing new knowledge, solving design and technical problems, overcoming different types of challenges present in contemporary profession, and improving the design outcomes. Innovation requires a much stronger correlation between research and design, and it is pertinent for the future of architectural practice that research becomes an integral part of architectural profession. This book provides a roadmap for successfully integrating research into architectural design and for establishing innovative practices, regardless of a firm's size. Written by an architecture professor with extensive research and professional background--specifically focusing on integrating research into practice--and richly illustrated with over 150 color images, this reference will be useful for both students and practitioners.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JhzazQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

THE character of Mr. Addison and bis writings, for justness of thought, strength of reasoning, and purity of style, is too well establilhed to need a recommendation; but their greatest ornament, and that which gives a lustre to all the rest, is his appearing, throughout, a zealous advocate for virtue and religion, against profanenefs and infidelity. And because his excellent discourses upon those subjects lie dispersed among his other writings, and are by that means not so generally known and read as they deserve, it was judged to be no unseasonable service to religion at this time, to move the Bookseller to publish them together in a distinct volume; in hopes, that the politeness and beauty peculiar to Mr. AddiSon's writings would make their way to persons of a superior character and a more liberal education; and, that as they come from the hands of a layman, they may be the more readily received and considered by young gentlemen, as a proper manual of religion. Our modern sceptics and infidels are great pretenders to reason and philosophy, and are willing to have it thought that none who are really possessed of those talents, can easily assent to the truth of Chri.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=31MaQQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Missing Among Us,Erin Stewart,Missing persons,,,"In Australia 38 000 people are reported missing each year and in the US it's over 600 000. In the UK someone is reported missing every 90 seconds. Many of these cases are never resolved. Blending long-form journalism with true crime and philosophy,The Missing Among Ustakes us from the Australian bush to the battlefields of Northern France and the perilous space of a refugee camp to explore the stories of the missing. Erin Stewart speaks to parents of missing children, former cult members, detectives and investigators, advocates working on the crisis of missing refugees, a child of the Stolen Generations and many more to trace the mysterious world of missing persons. Examining famous cases like that of Madeleine McCann to those who are lesser known yet equally loved and mourned, this unique book forces us to see the complex story behind each missing person and those they leave behind.

This is a rare book from a gifted writer: intelligent yet poignant, enlightening yet deeply disturbing.' -- Malcolm Knox 'The Missing Among Us is illuminating, profound and wise. Stewart is a distinct new voice and her inquiry into the gaps and absences so many of us try to gloss over is intelligent, gentle and brave.' -- Anna Krien 'A deeply moving and insightful exploration of the concept of ""missingness"".
