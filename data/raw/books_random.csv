China in and beyond the Headlines,"Timothy B. Weston, Lionel M. Jensen",Political Science,61.17 EUR,,"In the third volume of this popular series, leading experts provide fascinating and unexpected insights into critical issues of culture, economy, politics, and society in today's China. This world, outside the reach of state control and either misunderstood or unreported in Western media, gains clarity and dimension from the fresh insights of a prominent group of activists, investigative journalists, lawyers, scholars, and travelers, who share a common interest in lessening the profound information gap between China and the rest of the world. In sixteen new essays, they address such key topics as civil society, consumerism, environmental adversity, ethnic tension, the Internet, legal reform, new media and social networking, nationalist tourism, sex and popular culture, as well the costs of urban gigantism to portray the complexity of life in contemporary China—and how, increasingly, it speaks to the everyday experience of Americans.

Lupin asked if Mr. Hargrove was at home. ""Mr. Hargrove went out about half-an-hour ago,"" said the publican. ""He seemed very much excited and took a taxi-cab, a thing he doesn't often do."" ""And you don't know...."" ""Where he was going? Well, there's no secret about it He shouted it loud enough! 'Prefecture of Police' is what he said to the driver....""

""Yes, an old gentleman with a grey beard and spectacles. He went up to Mr. Hargrove's, rang the bell, and went away again."" ""I am much obliged,"" said Lupin, touching his hat.

The Lost Gutenberg,Margaret Leslie Davis,History,10.22 EUR,,"“A lively tale of historical innovation, the thrill of the bibliophile’s hunt, greed and betrayal.” – The New York Times Book Review ""An addictive and engaging look at the ‘competitive, catty and slightly angst-ridden’ heart of the world of book collecting.” - The Houston Chronicle The never-before-told story of one extremely rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible, and its impact on the lives of the fanatical few who were lucky enough to own it. For rare-book collectors, an original copy of the Gutenberg Bible--of which there are fewer than 50 in existence--represents the ultimate prize. Here, Margaret Leslie Davis recounts five centuries in the life of one copy, from its creation by Johannes Gutenberg, through the hands of monks, an earl, the Worcestershire sauce king, and a nuclear physicist to its ultimate resting place, in a steel vault in Tokyo. Estelle Doheny, the first woman collector to add the book to her library and its last private owner, tipped the Bible onto a trajectory that forever changed our understanding of the first mechanically printed book. The Lost Gutenberg draws readers into this incredible saga, immersing them in the lust for beauty, prestige, and knowledge that this rarest of books sparked in its owners. Exploring books as objects of obsession across centuries, this is a must-read for history buffs, book collectors, seekers of hidden treasures, and anyone who has ever craved a remarkable book--and its untold stories.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0chqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Lost Mona Lisa,R. A. Scotti,Art forgers,,,"Late on the afternoon of Sunday, August 20 1911, three men strolled through the Louvre. Disguising themselves as museum staff they hid until nightfall. Sixteen hours later the most famous painting in the world, the Mona Lisa, had vanished. It took twenty-four hours for anyone in the museum to notice. When the alarm went out, the police rushed to the museum. The doors were locked, staff and visitors were detained, but the painting was long gone. France sealed her borders. And when the museum reopened a week after the theft, Parisians queued up in record numbers to view the blank space where the famous painting once hung. A huge police hunt continued, but months passed with no breakthrough in the case. It seemed that the theft of the Mona Lisa was the perfect crime. Two years later in Florence, art dealer Alfredo Geri received a letter signed 'Leonardo'. The Mona Lisa was for sale; the price half a million dollars. A meeting was arranged and 'Leonardo' was persuaded to let Geri remove the painting and take it to the Uffizi for authentication. The moment Geri left the hotel he called the police. Minutes later 'Leonardo' - aka Vincenzo Peruggia - was arrested. In a further twist, Peruggia was hailed as a national hero in Italy. He portrayed himself as a nationalist, who only stole back what rightly belonged to Italy. The Mona Lisa was brought back to Paris with much fanfare. But what of the other two men from the Louvre heist? Their story is even more incredible. Eduardo de Valfierno, an Argentine con man, was the brains behind the operation. Together with art forger Yves Chaudron, he planned a truly audacious crime. Chaudron forged six copies of the Mona Lisa. They then employed Peruggia to help steal the original. When news of the heist hit the international headlines Eduardo sold the six fakes to wealthy collectors, each of whom believed he was buying the original, netting the equivalent of $90 million in today's money. Neither man was convicted for their part in the theft. The whereabouts of the fakes remains a mystery.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QKc1AAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Bomb and the Soviet Embassy in Tirana,Uran Butka,History,,,"THE BOMB AND THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN TIRANA The book by the writer and historian Uran Butka “ The bomb and the Soviet Embassy in Tirana” recently translated from Albanian to English, is a historical-legal study of one of the typical massacres of the brutal communist regime in Albania. The massacre that took place on the night of the 26th of February 1951 is at the same time the most illegal and unprecedented in the history of both the Albanian and foreign legislation. First of all, because the decision to realize the plan of the massacre took place not in the court of law but in the office of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Albania, on the gathering of the night of the 20th February 1951, with the pretext that a small amount of dynamite was thrown in the backyard of the Soviet Embassy that actually broke just a few glasses the night before the meeting. This caused the immediate gathering of the heads of the State-Party leaded by Enver Hoxha . The meeting was called by the Minister of Internal Affairs Mehmet Shehu. In this meeting was decided that extraordinary measures had to be made without considering the laws in force, 100 or 150 people had to be arrested immediately and the most important people 10 or 15 amongst them had to be executed without trial. <<We have to kill more people to maintain power >>- said Mehmet Shehu during the meeting. Secondly, the arrests that were executed during 20th and 23d of February 1951, were not just political but also illegal, because they were executed without an arrest order or warrant from the prosecutor and without any court order of any kind, the names were taken only by the death list made by State Security. Another reason is that no investigation was made no court no appeal, so every step of the criminal and civil code were trespassed and violated . The victims were executed by a firing squad secretly at midnight near the shore of Erzeni river, so that all evidence would disappear. An massive operation also took place to deport their families into concentration and work camps. Last but not least , since the execution without trial made the headlines, within and outside the country, and since it involved the Soviet Embassy, the Supreme Court decided to make fictitious records, as these records were made during trial, but two members of the Supreme Court, Hydai Beja and Nonda Papuli, refused to sign these documents since no court had been made. So among other things a forgery of the documents was made to legitimize the massacre. All these jurisdictional and administrative violations failed to cover up the massacre without trial and with no guilt proven . In this way these known intellectuals from all over Albania with no trial were executed, to arouse fear terror and submission to the regime, but also to strength the friendship with the Soviet Union and the Stalinist way of dictatorship. But these man had no connection with this crime and they had no connection with each other.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8tijBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

"The World War and What Was Behind It Or, the Story of the Map of Europe",Louis Paul Benezet,,,,"The World War and What was Behind It Or, the Story of the Map of Europe by Louis Paul Benezet Chapter I The Great War The call from Europe.-Friend against friend.-Why?-Death and devastation.-No private quarrel.-Ordered by government.-What makes government?-The influence of the past.-Four causes of war. Among the bricklayers at work on a building which was being erected in a great American city during the summer of 1914 were two men who had not yet become citizens of the United States. Born abroad, they still owed allegiance, one to the Emperor of Austria, the other to the Czar of Russia. Meeting in a new country, and using a new language which gave them a chance to understand each other, they had become well acquainted. They were members of the same labor union, and had worked side by side on several different jobs. In the course of time, a firm friendship had sprung up between them. Suddenly, on the same day, each was notified to call at the office of the agent of his government in the city. Next morning the Russian came to his boss to explain that he must quit work, that he had been called home to fight for the ""Little Father"" of the Russians. He found his chum, the Austrian, there ahead of him, telling that he had to go, for the Russians had declared war on Austria and the good Kaiser, Franz Josef, had need of all his young men. 1In the German language, the title Kaiser means Emperor. The two chums stared at each other in sorrow and dismay. The pitiless arm of the god of war had reached across the broad Atlantic, plucking them back from peace and security. With weapons put into their hands they would be ordered to kill each other on sight. A last hand-clasp, a sorrowful ""Good luck to you,"" and they parted. Why was this necessary? What was this irresistible force, strong enough to separate the two friends and drag them back five thousand miles for the purpose of killing each other? To answer these two questions is the purpose of this little volume. Beginning with the summer of 1914, Europe and parts of Asia and Africa were torn and racked with the most tremendous war that the world has ever seen. Millions of men were killed. Other millions were maimed, blinded, or disfigured for life. Still other millions were herded into prison camps or forced to work like convict laborers. Millions of homes were filled with grief. Millions of women were forced to do hard work which before the war had been considered beyond their power. Millions of children were left fatherless. What had been the richest and most productive farming land in Europe was made a barren waste. Thousands of villages and towns were utterly destroyed and their inhabitants were forced to flee, the aged, the sick, and the infants alike. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public.

The Correspondence of Catharine Macaulay,Karen Green,Philosophy,27.04 EUR,,"Catharine Macaulay was a celebrated republican historian, whose account of the reasons for the seventeenth-century English Revolution, the parliamentary period, and its aftermath was widely read by the mothers and fathers of American Independence and by central players in the French Revolution. As well as publishing her eight volume history, spanning the period from the accession of James I to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, she wrote political pamphlets, offered a sketch of a republican constitution for Corsica, advocated parliamentary reform, and published a response to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France. Her Letters on Education of 1790 made a decisive impact on the thought of Mary Wollstonecraft, and her Treatise on the Immutability of Moral Truth opposed the skeptical and utilitarian attitudes being developed by Hume and others. This volume brings together for the first time all the available letters between her and her wide-ranging correspondents, who include George Washington, John Adams, Abigail Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, James Otis, Benjamin Rush, David Hume, James Boswell, Thomas Hollis, John Wilkes, Horace Walpole, Mary Wollstonecraft, Jacques-Pierre Brissot de Warville, and many other luminaries of the eighteenth-century enlightenment. It includes an extended introduction to her life and works and offers a unique insight into the thinking of her friends and correspondents during the period between 1760 and 1790, the crucible for the development of modern representative democracies. The Correspondence of Catharine Macaulay will appeal to scholars of philosophy, political thought, women's studies, and eighteenth-century history, as well as those interested in the development of democratic ideas.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3varDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Mayor of Casterbridge,Thomas Hardy,,,,"The Mayor of Casterbridge The Life and Death of a Man of Character by Thomas Hardy The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), subtitled ""The Life and Death of a Man of Character"", is a novel by British author Thomas Hardy. It is set in the fictional town of Casterbridge (based on the town of Dorchester in Dorset). The book is one of Hardy's Wessex novels, all set in a fictional rural England. At a country fair near Casterbridge, Wessex, a young hay-trusser named Michael Henchard overindulges in rum-laced furmity and quarrels with his wife, Susan. He decides to auction off his wife and baby daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, to a sailor, Mr. Newson, for five guineas. Once sober the next day, he is too late to recover his family. When he realises that his wife and daughter are gone, probably for good, he swears not to touch liquor again for as many years as he has lived so far. Eighteen years later, Henchard, now a successful grain merchant, is the eponymous Mayor of Casterbridge, known for his staunch sobriety. All these years, Henchard has kept the details surrounding the ""loss"" of his wife a secret. The people in Casterbridge believe he is a widower, although he never explicitly says that his first wife died. He lies by omission instead, allowing other people to believe something false. Over time he finds it convenient to believe Susan probably is dead. While travelling to the island of Jersey on business, Henchard falls in love with a young woman named Lucette Le Sueur, who nurses him back to health after an illness. The book implies that Lucette (Lucetta, in English) and Henchard have a sexual relationship, and Lucetta's reputation is ruined by her association with Henchard. The latter returns to Casterbridge, leaving Lucetta to face the social consequences of their fling. To rejoin polite society Lucetta would have to marry him, but there is an obvious problem: Henchard is already technically married. Although Henchard never told Lucetta exactly how he ""lost"" his wife to begin with, he does tell her he has a wife who ""is dead probably dead, but who may return"". Besotted, Lucetta develops a relationship with him despite the risk. Yet just as Henchard is about to send for Lucetta, Susan unexpectedly appears in Casterbridge with her daughter, Elizabeth-Jane, who is now fully grown. The pair are very poor. Newson appears to have been lost at sea, and without means to earn an income Susan is looking to Henchard again. Susan, who is not a very intelligent or sophisticated woman, believed for a long time that her ""marriage"" to Newson was perfectly legitimate. Only recently, just before Newson's disappearance, had Susan begun to question whether or not she was still legally married to Henchard.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CKV_jwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
The Essential Chomsky,"Noam Chomsky, Joshua Daniel",Language Arts & Disciplines,,,"In a single volume, the seminal writings of the world's leading philosopher, linguist, and critic, published to coincide with his eightieth birthday. For the past forty years Noam Chomsky's writings on politics and language have established him as a preeminent public intellectual and as one of the most original and wide-ranging political and social critics of our time. Among the seminal figures in linguistic theory over the past century, since the 1960s Chomsky has also secured a place as perhaps the leading dissident voice in the United States. Chomsky's many bestselling works--including ""Manufacturing Consent, Hegemony or Survival, Understanding Power,"" and ""Failed States""--have served as essential touchstones for dissidents, activists, scholars, and concerned citizens on subjects ranging from the media to human rights to intellectual freedom. In particular, Chomsky's scathing critiques of the U.S. wars in Vietnam, Central America, and the Middle East have furnished a widely accepted intellectual inspiration for antiwar movements over nearly four decades. The Essential Chomsky assembles the core of his most important writings, including excerpts from his most influential texts over the past forty years.

The Glory of the Trenches,Coningsby Dawson,,,,"I am in hospital in London, lying between clean white sheets and feeling, for the first time in months, clean all over. At the end of the ward there is a swinging door; if I listen intently in the intervals when the gramophone isn't playing, I can hear the sound of bath-water running-running in a reckless kind of fashion as if it didn't care how much was wasted. To me, so recently out of the fighting and so short a time in Blighty, it seems the finest music in the world. For the sheer luxury of the contrast I close my eyes against the July sunlight and imagine myself back in one of those narrow dug-outs where it isn't the thing to undress because the row may start at any minute. Out there in France we used to tell one another fairy-tales of how we would spend the first year of life when war was ended. One man had a baby whom he'd never seen; another a girl whom he was anxious to marry. My dream was more prosaic, but no less ecstatic-it began and ended with a large white bed and a large white bath. For the first three hundred and sixty-five mornings after peace had been declared I was to be wakened by the sound of my bath being filled; water was to be so plentiful that I could tumble off to sleep again without even troubling to turn off the tap. In France one has to go dirty so often that the dream of being always clean seems as unrealisable as romance. Our drinking-water is frequently brought up to us at the risk of men's lives, carried through the mud in petrol-cans strapped on to packhorses. To use it carelessly would be like washing in men's blood-- And here, most marvellously, with my dream come true, I lie in the whitest of white beds. The sunlight filters through trees outside the window and weaves patterns on the floor. Most wonderful of all is the sound of the water so luxuriously running. Some one hops out of bed and re-starts the gramophone. The music of the bath-room tap is lost. - Taken from ""The Trenches of Glory"" written by Coningsby Dawson",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iJkGzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
The Subversive Stitch,Rozsika Parker,Crafts & Hobbies,,,"Rozsika Parker's re-evaluation of the reciprocal relationship between women and embroidery has brought stitchery out from the private world of female domesticity into the fine arts, created a major breakthrough in art history and criticism, and fostered the emergence of today's dynamic and expanding crafts movements. The Subversive Stitch is now available again with a new Introduction that brings the book up to date with exploration of the stitched art of Louise Bourgeois and Tracey Emin, as well as the work of new young female and male embroiderers. Rozsika Parker uses household accounts, women's magazines, letters, novels and the works of art themselves to trace through history how the separation of the craft of embroidery from the fine arts came to be a major force in the marginalisation of women's work. Beautifully illustrated, her book also discusses the contradictory nature of women's experience of embroidery: how it has inculcated female subservience while providing an immensely pleasurable source of creativity, forging links between women.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gHInxAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
The Chronicles of St Mary's Omnibus: Three Extraordinary Adventures,Jodi Taylor,Fiction,,,"The first three extraordinary adventures in the Chronicles of St Mary's series, now available together in ebook. If you love Jasper Fforde or Ben Aaronovitch, you won't be able to resist Jodi Taylor. 'The Chronicles of St Mary's are the stories of a bunch of time travelling historians who investigate major historical events in contemporary time. Do NOT call it time travel. They are frequently described as ""a bunch of tea-sodden disaster magnets"", bouncing from crisis to catastrophe and back again. For is it not written, where historians go disaster is sure to follow?' - Jodi Taylor In these first three novels, meet the disaster magnets of St Mary's as they hurtle their way around History. JUST ONE DAMNED THING AFTER ANOTHER When Madeleine Maxwell is recruited by the St Mary's Institute of Historical Research, she discovers the historians there don't just study the past - they revisit it. But one wrong move and History will fight back - to the death. And she soon discovers it's not just History she's fighting... A SYMPHONY OF ECHOES Dispatched to Victorian London to seek out Jack the Ripper, things go badly wrong when he finds the St Mary's historians first. Stalked through the fog-shrouded streets of Whitechapel, Max is soon running for her life. Again. A SECOND CHANCE It began well. A successful assignment to 17th century Cambridge to meet Isaac Newton, and another to witness the historic events at The Gates of Grief. So far so good. But then came the long-awaited jump to the Trojan War that changed everything. And for Max, nothing will ever be the same again. Readers love Jodi Taylor: 'Once in a while, I discover an author who changes everything... Jodi Taylor and her protagonista Madeleine ""Max"" Maxwell have seduced me' 'A great mix of British proper-ness and humour with a large dollop of historical fun' 'Addictive. I wish St Mary's was real and I was a part of it' 'Jodi Taylor has an imagination that gets me completely hooked' 'A tour de force'",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WcHcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
The Educational Covenant,"Jose Granados, M. R. Samuel Aquila, Juan Antonio Granados",Education,,,"The Educational Covenant is a refreshing challenge to the modern utilitarian understanding of education in our culture. It positively provokes educators and evangelizers alike to take a closer examination of what it means to educate (blurb, Mary Cohen, Associate Superintendent of Catholic Schools, Denver)Taking Christ as its pedagogical model, The Educational Covenant explores the real mission of authentic education: to reveal the human person, to embrace a horizon greater than the human person, and ultimately to form hearts, minds, and bodies to pursue our human destiny as beings on a journey to God.

The PARASITE a Story,Arthur Conan Doyle,,,,"THE PARASITE A StoryThe Parasite is an 1894 novelette by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.The main character is a young man known as Austin Gilroy. He studies physiology and knows a professor who is studying the occult. The young man is introduced to a middle-aged woman known as Miss Penclosa, who has a crippled leg and psychic powers. She is a friend of the Professor's wife. The skeptical Gilroy's fianc�e, Agatha, is put into a trance to prove Miss Penclosa's powers. This succeeds and Gilroy begins to go to the Professor's house where Miss Penclosa practices her powers on him . This is so Gilroy can look at the physical part of the powers.Miss Penclosa 'falls in love' with the unfortunate Gilroy. She starts to use her powers on him to make him caress and utter sweet nothings to her. He loses his temper, rejects her love, and she begins to play tricks on him with her powers. The series of cruel tricks ends with him in Agatha's room carrying a small bottle of sulphuric acid. He notices that it is half-past three. He rushes to Miss Penclosa's home and demands for her presence at the door. The nurse there answers in a frightened tone that she died at half-past three.ARTHUR CONAN DOYLESir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle (22 May 1859 - 7 July 1930) was a British writer best known for his detective fiction featuring the character Sherlock Holmes. Originally a physician, in 1887 he published A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels about Holmes and Dr. Watson. In addition, Doyle wrote over fifty short stories featuring the famous detective.The Sherlock Holmes stories are generally considered milestones in the field of crime fiction. Doyle is also known for writing the fictional adventures of Professor Challenger and for propagating the mystery of the Mary Celeste. He was a prolific writer whose other works include fantasy and science fiction stories, plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels.Doyle is often referred to as ""Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"" or simply ""Conan Doyle"" (implying that Conan is part of a compound surname, as opposed to his given middle name). His baptism entry in the register of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, gives ""Arthur Ignatius Conan"" as his given names and ""Doyle"" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his godfather. The cataloguers of the British Library and the Library of Congress treat ""Doyle"" alone as his surname. Steven Doyle, editor of the Baker Street Journal, wrote, ""Conan was Arthur's middle name. Shortly after he graduated from high school he began using Conan as a sort of surname. But technically his last name is simply 'Doyle'."" When knighted, he was gazetted as Doyle, not under the compound Conan Doyle. Nevertheless, the actual use of a compound surname is demonstrated by the fact that Doyle's second wife was known as Jean Conan Doyle rather than Jean Doyle.",

This has not only enriched our understanding of Chaucer's art, but has also enabled scholars, working for the first time with all thesource-material, to recreate Chaucer's authentic texts.For the third edition, an international team of experts completely re-edited all the works, added glosses to appear on the page with the text, andgreatly expanded the introductory material, explanatory notes, textual notes, bibliography, and glossary.In short, the Riverside Chaucer is the fruit of many years' study - the most authentic and exciting edition available of Chaucer's Complete Works.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E4DXD7Sk7WcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

"Science, Society, and the Search for Life in the Universe",Bruce M. Jakosky,Science,,,"Are we alone in the universe? As humans, are we unique or are we part of a greater cosmic existence? What is lifeÕs future on Earth and beyond? How does life begin and develop? These are age-old questions that have inspired wonder and controversy ever since the first people looked up into the sky. With todayÕs technology, however, we are closer than ever to finding the answers. Astrobiology is the relatively new, but fast growing scientific discipline that involves trying to understand the origin, evolution, and distribution of life within the universe. It is also one of the few scientific disciplines that attracts the publicÕs intense curiosity and attention. This interest stems largely from the deep personal meaning that the possible existence of extraterrestrial life has for so many. Whether this meaning relates to addressing the ÒBig QuestionsÓ of our existence, the possibility of encountering life on other planets, or the potential impact on our understanding of religion, there is no doubt that the public is firmly vested in finding answers. In this broadly accessible introduction to the field, Bruce Jakosky looks at the search for life in the universe not only from a scientific perspective, but also from a distinctly social one. In lucid and engaging prose, he addresses topics including the contradiction between the publicÕs fascination and the meager dialogue that exists between those within the scientific community and those outside of it, and what has become some of the most impassioned political wrangling ever seen in government science funding.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JKuTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Bob Hope Films,James L. Neibaur,Performing Arts,,,"Bob Hope got his start in show business when he was in his twenties, remained active past the age of 90, and lived to be 100. His longevity was remarkable, especially when one considers that he was active in vaudeville, radio, motion pictures and television. He excelled in each of these popular forms of entertainment, but his films are the most genuine testaments to his timeless comedy. His smart quips, fast pace, and breezy manner were perfect ingredients for the brand of comedy that was popular during World War II and the years immediately following the war. This book begins with a discussion of Bob Hope's early career and the short films that he starred in, and then covers each of the Hope films beginning with The Big Broadcast of 1938. The Hope films, the author says, do not have deep subtexts or clever cinematic innovations, but provide clever, uplifting entertainment that continues to inspire laughter and offer solid examples of the humor that made Americans smile during and after World War II.

The Future Of Homo,Michel Odent,Medical,13.58 EUR,,"'This book should be read by anyone involved in birth work, and in future oriented scientific disciplines, anyone working on sustainable development goals, resilience, and planetary boundaries. It is an essential read for explorers of the future and people necessitating transdisciplinary science to explore solutions for our planetary crises ... His writing is clear and organized, the chapters can be very short, his argumentation is persuasive and can seem disconnected at times until the connection is found; we enter the brain of a great systems thinker ...; Michel Odent's scientifically evidenced linkages between seemingly disconnected events grows our understanding of interconnectedness; a key quality for the survival of humanity.'Midwifery TodayAt a global scale, love hormones are now redundant in the critical period surrounding birth ... reasons for questions?Between 1970 and 1990, in many parts of the world, the rates of caesareans escalated from roughly 5% to roughly 25%. During this short phase of history, the father's participation became routine. Is there a link between these facts?Health care systems are on the way to collapsing. Should we go on focusing on the preventive and curative treatments of particular diseases or should we give a greater importance to the way our basic adaptive systems, involved in what we commonly call health, reach a high degree of maturity?These examples are sufficient to illustrate the 'neo-Socratic attitude' of the author. Our contemporaries are constantly dealing with unprecedented situations. Question marks, therefore, can symbolise the current phase of our history. Throughout this book, radically new situations are analysed, before appropriate questions are phrased.At a time when people commonly debate on the long-term effects of human activities without considering the probable transformations of Homo, one cannot avoid a preliminary question: How to reach an audience made up of female and male open-minded people who are turned towards the future but have not yet realised that the important period surrounding birth has been radically transformed during the past decades?In the age of cultural blindness related to overspecialization, The Future of Homo is also a training tool to think across boundaries.Related Link(s)",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u5mxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
The Peloponnesian War,John Francis Lazenby,History,,,"The range and extent of the Peloponnesian War of the fifth century BC has led to it being described as a 'world war' in miniature. With the struggle between Athens and Sparta at its core, the twenty-seven-year conflict drew in states from all points of the compass; from Byzantion in the north, Crete in the south, Asia Minor in the east and Sicily in the west. Since Thucydides described the war as 'the greatest disturbance to befall the Greeks' numerous studies have been made of individual episodes and topics. This authoritative work is the first single-volume study of the entire war to be published in over seventy-five years. Lazenby avoids the tendency of allowing historiography to obscure the analysis, and while paying due attention to detail, also looks at the fundamental questions of warfare raised by the conflict. Within a narrative framework, Lazenby concentrates on the fighting itself, and examining the way in which both strategy and tactics developed as the conflict spread. Not afraid to challenge accepted views, he assesses the war as a military rather than a political endeavour, evaluating issues such as the advantages and limitations of sea power. A readable and clear survey, this text offers a balanced discussion of controversial themes, and will appeal to ancient historians, classicists and all those who are interested in military history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYOTmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Ambivalent Detective in Victorian Sensation Novels,Sarah Yoon,Fiction,55.63 EUR,,"The Ambivalent Detective in Victorian Sensation Novels studies how the detective as a literary character evolved through the mid-nineteenth century in England, as seen in sensation novels. In contrast to most assumptions about the English detective, Yoon argues that the detective was more often tolerated than admired following the establishment of professional detectives in the London Metropolitan Police Force in 1842. Through studying the historical and literary contexts between the 1840s to the 1860s, Yoon argues that the detective was seen as a suspicious, even mistrusted and disdained, figure who was nonetheless viewed as necessary to combat rising levels of crime. The detective as a literary character responded to the often contradictory values and aspirations of the middle class, representing an independent masculinity and laying claim to scientific authority. This study surveys novels by Charles Dickens, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, and Wilkie Collins, alongside lesser-known writers like William Russell, James Redding Ware (pseudonym Andrew Forrester), and William Stephens Hayward. This book contributes to the study of mid-nineteenth-century Victorian culture and connects with broader studies of the detective fiction genre.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=My7yEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Science and Religion in Neo-Victorian Novels,John Glendening,Literary Criticism,41.72 EUR,,"Criticism about the neo-Victorian novel — a genre of historical fiction that re-imagines aspects of the Victorian world from present-day perspectives — has expanded rapidly in the last fifteen years but given little attention to the engagement between science and religion. Of great interest to Victorians, this subject often appears in neo-Victorian novels including those by such well-known authors as John Fowles, A. S. Byatt, Graham Swift, and Mathew Kneale. This book discusses novels in which nineteenth-century science, including geology, paleontology, and evolutionary theory, interacts with religion through accommodations, conflicts, and crises of faith. In general, these texts abandon conventional religion but retain the ethical connectedness and celebration of life associated with spirituality at its best. Registering the growth of nineteenth-century secularism and drawing on aspects of the romantic tradition and ecological thinking, they honor the natural world without imagining that it exists for humans or functions in reference to human values. In particular, they enact a form of wonderment: the capacity of the mind to make sense of, creatively adapt, and enjoy the world out of which it has evolved — in short, to endow it with meaning. Protagonists who come to experience reality in this expansive way release themselves from self-anxiety and alienation. In this book, Glendening shows how, by intermixing past and present, fact and fiction, neo-Victorian narratives, with a few instructive exceptions, manifest this pattern.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8WvDwKgcyQcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Global Voices,"Joseph O'Beirne Milner, Carol Ann Pope",Foreign Language Study,,,"This book presents essays that reflect the dialogue and the spirit of conversation of the 1990 International Federation for the Teaching of English (IFTE) Conference in Auckland, New Zealand. The book begins with some of the impressions of the IFTE conference held by the classroom teachers, school administrators, writers, and scholars who attended it. Language diversity in the classroom is the focus of several essays in the second part of the book. Each essay in the second part of the book is followed by a response. The pairing of essays continues in the third section of the book, where issues such as who controls curricula and who sets the standards for curricula are addressed. The third part of the book also discuses national curriculum movements in New Zealand and the United Kingdom; English as a Second Language pedagogies; and international underpinnings of the whole language movement. The initial essay in each set is a response to a paper presented at the conference; the second is the original presenter's reply to the author of the first essay. The fourth part of the book presents essays about the history and future of IFTE conferences, looking forward especially to the 1995 conference to be held in New York City.

Ceremony and Civility in English Renaissance Prose,Anne Drury Hall,History,,,"Ceremony and Civility in English Renaissance Prose analyzes the emergence of civil prose in texts of the early modern period and defends English Renaissance writers against the current attack on their aristocratic politics. Using Thomas More's History of King Richard III, Philip Sydney's Defense of Poetry, Richard Hooker's Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, and Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, Anne Hall demonstrates the emerging differentiation of civil and ceremonial prose in the early modern period. These works combine ceremonial discourse, acknowledging such traditional values as a God-centered world, and civil prose with its circumspections and irony, thus revealing a philosophical awareness of the complexity of moral and political questions. Since the 1970s, there have been two chief arguments about Renaissance literature. The first is that most Renaissance writers used traditional forms to bolster authority and that they should be regarded with suspicion. The second is that some Renaissance writers altered traditional forms to subvert authority and that they should be admired. Anne Hall contends that there is an alternative position--that many Renaissance writers used tradition to bolster authority and that their versions of tradition and authority deserve a defense that responds to current attacks on their racism, violence, and colonialist repression in texts that were once thought to be about love and education. Hall argues that Renaissance writers could not foresee the ways in which they would need to defend their position against Enlightenment attack, and she supplies what she believes would have been their defense, concluding that such Renaissance discourse must not be considered solely on a historical basis but also from a philosophical viewpoint.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aOJZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Margaret Atwood,Nathalie Cooke,Biography & Autobiography,,,"This book offers readers a concise introduction to Atwood's published novels and the central themes motivating her writing. The volume starts with an overview of the author's biography and the relationship of her writing to relevant literary traditions. Because Atwood is internationally renowned, many commentaries ignore the Canadian roots of her work. Cooke corrects this oversight by sketching the ways in which her work is shaped by, and has shaped, the Canadian literary scene. As the author of a full-length Atwood biography, Cooke is able to summarize feminist, Canadian nationalist, and postmodern influences on Atwood's work and on her development as a writer. The book offers close scrutiny of three illustrative works: Cat's Eye as the artist novel, The Handmaid's Tale as a dystopian novel, and The Blind Assassin as a villainess novel. This book extends the dialogue surrounding Atwood's work in several important ways. As a book written by a Canadian about a Canadian writer, it illustrates how readings of Atwood's work can be significantly enriched through attention to the Canadian literary and cultural context. Noting that Atwood's work not only entertains but also challenges and disturbs, it argues that all of Atwood's novels can be read as satires that expose society's double standards. By locating the beginnings of satire as far back as Atwood's first published novel, and tracing it in Atwood's later novels as the impulse behind challenges to character (in the artist novels), setting (in the dystopic fiction), and plot (in the villainess novels), this study provides a startlingly original interpretation of The Blind Assassin and new insights into the earlier novels.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BcRlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Work-Life-Balance. Ein möglicher Weg zur beruflichen Chancengleichheit der Geschlechter?,Maria Korosteljow,,,,"Work-Life-Balance: ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis von Beruf und Privatleben. Oder könnte es für Arbeitnehmerinnen viel mehr sein - die Möglichkeit auf Karriere und Kinder? Frauen sind zwar inzwischen fest auf dem Arbeitsmarkt integriert und können sich auch zunehmend zu Führungs- oder Fachkräften hocharbeiten. Doch das Geschlechterverhältnis hat sich in vielen Faktoren kaum verändert. Nach wie vor stellt sich vor allem für Frauen die Frage: Wie können Beruf, Familie und Haushalt vereinbart werden? Maria Korosteljow untersucht, ob Work-Life-Balance-Maßnahmen den bestehenden beruflichen Ungleichheiten zwischen Männern und Frauen durch eine bessere Vereinbarkeit zwischen Beruf und Familie entgegenwirken können. Sie skizziert potenzielle Maßnahmen zur Lösung dieses gesellschaftlich brisanten Themas.

On the Meaning of Life,"Will Durant, Owen C. Middleton",,,,"In the Fall of 1930 Will Durant found himself outside his home in Lake Hill, New York, raking leaves. He was approached by a well-dressed man who told him in a quiet tone that he was going to kill himself unless the philosopher could give him a valid reason not to. Not having the time to wax philosophic on the matter, Durant did his best to furnish the man with reasons to continue his existence. Haunted by the encounter with the despondent stranger, Durant contacted 100 luminaries in the arts, politics, religion and sciences, challenging them to respond not only to the fundamental question of life's meaning (in the abstract) but also to relate how they each (in the particular) found meaning, purpose and fulfillment in their own lives. Durant turned their answers and his own into a book entitled ""On The Meaning Of Life,"" which was released to the general public in 1932. Unpromoted, the litte treasure found its way into few hands, and almost no copies of the book exist today. Now available for a new generation through Promethean Press, ""On The Meaning Of Life"" is a powerful book on a very powerful topic. In this book Will Durant has fashioned an unprecedented ""dream team"" of luminaries that is both profound and diverse: poets, philosophers, saints, inmates, athletes, Nobel Prize winners, college professors, psychologists, entertainers, musicians, authors and leaders. Within their varied insights, despite their uniqueness as individuals and the very different lives they led, the reader will note a consistent thread running through their viewpoints, revealing a commonality among human beings who not only seek meaning in life, but who actually achieve it.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MG8W_gAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Life's Devices,Steven Vogel,Science,,,"An entertaining and informative book that explores how living things contend with nonbiological reality Life on Earth is subject to the pull of gravity, the properties of air and water, and the behavior of diffusing molecules, yet such physical factors are constraints that drive evolution and offer untold opportunities to creatures of all sizes. In this lively introduction to the science of biomechanics, Steven Vogel invites you to wonder about the design of the plants and animals around us. You will learn why a fish swims more rapidly than a duck can paddle, why healthy trees more commonly uproot than break, how sharks manage with such flimsy skeletons, and why a mouse can easily survive a fall onto any surface from any height. With an illuminating foreword by Rob Dunn, this Princeton Science Library edition of Life’s Devices includes examples from every major group of animals and plants along with illustrative problems and suggestions for experiments that require only common household materials.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I2o0EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Life - As a Matter of Fat,Ole G.

Emphasizes the physical properties of lipid membranes seen as soft and molecularly structured interfaces. By combining and synthesizing insights obtained from a variety of recent studies, an attempt is made to clarify what membrane structure is and how it can be quantitatively described. Shows how biological function mediated by membranes is controlled by lipid membrane structure and organization on length scales ranging from the size of the individual molecule, across molecular assemblies of proteins and lipid domains in the range of nanometers, to the size of whole cells. Applications of lipids in nano-technology and biomedicine are also described.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3J9enifNNTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
My Life and Loves,Frank Harris,"Authors, English",,,,
The Painting of Modern Life,Timothy J. Clark,Art,,,"From T.J. Clark comes this provocative study of the origins of modern art in the painting of Parisian life by Edouard Manet and his followers. The Paris of the 1860s and 1870s was a brand-new city, recently adorned with boulevards, cafes, parks, Great Exhibitions, and suburban pleasure grounds-the birthplace of the habits of commerce and leisure that we ourselves know as ""modern life."" A new kind of culture quickly developed in this remade metropolis, sights and spectacles avidly appropriated by a new kind of ""consumer"": clerks and shopgirls, neither working class nor bourgeois, inventing their own social position in a system profoundly altered by their very existence. Emancipated and rootless, these men and women flocked to the bars and nightclubs of Paris, went boating on the Seine at Argenteuil, strolled the island of La Grande-Jatte-enacting a charade of community that was to be captured and scrutinized by Manet, Degas, and Seurat. It is Clark's cogently argued (and profusely illustrated) thesis that modern art emerged from these painters' attempts to represent this new city and its inhabitants. Concentrating on three of Manet's greatest works and Seurat's masterpiece, Clark traces the appearance and development of the artists' favorite themes and subjects, and the technical innovations that they employed to depict a way of life which, under its liberated, pleasure-seeking surface, was often awkward and anxious. Through their paintings, Manet and the Impressionists ask us, and force us to ask ourselves: Is the freedom offered by modernity a myth' Is modern life heroic or monotonous, glittering or tawdry, spectacular or dull' The Painting of Modern Life illuminates for us the ways, both forceful and subtle, in which Manet and his followers raised these questions and doubts, which are as valid for our time as for the age they portrayed.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MozuAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Life Is A Game,Mev Dinc,Biography & Autobiography,6.23 EUR,,"Life Is A Game tracks the fascinating life and successful career of legendary game developer Mev Dinc. The story begins in a mountainous Black Sea village; his father left him and his mother when Mev was only six months old, and with no home and thrown into poverty, they were left to survive the harsh winters alone. By the time he'd arrived in the UK in 1979, he had an English wife but couldn't speak a word of English. He then bought a ZX Spectrum in 1983 without any desire to use it. But through his resilience and ingrained will to overcome any obstacles, he learned to speak English, and taught himself programming and game development - all in two years! The rest, as they say, is history! This incredible story shows how Mev Dinc came from these humble beginnings and ended up becoming an award-winning developer, a member of BAFTA and the founding father of the Turkish Gaming Sector. This intriguing rags-to-riches tale will inspire as much as it entertains. ""Mev is a legend!"" - Jon Dean. ""A fantastic career"" - Steve Merrett ""I'm proud of Mev's achievements"" - Jon Hare.

Design for Life,Stuart Walker,Architecture,,,"Stuart Walker’s design work has been described as life-changing, inspiring, disturbing and ferocious. Drawing on an extraordinarily diverse range of sources and informed by creative practice, Design for Life penetrates to the heart of modern culture and the malaise that underlies today’s moral and environmental crises. The author argues that this malaise is deep-seated and fundamental to the modern outlook. He shows how our preoccupation with technological progress, growth and the future has produced a constricted view of life – one that is both destructive and self-reinforcing. Based on over twenty-five years of scholarship and creative practice, he demonstrates the vital importance of solitude, contemplation, inner growth and the present moment in developing a different course – one that looks squarely at our current, precarious situation while offering a positive, hopeful way forward – a way that is compassionate, context-based, human scale, ethically motivated and critically creative. Design for Life is an intensely original contribution that will be essential reading for design practitioners and students. Written in a clear, accessible style, it will also appeal to a broader readership, especially anyone who is concerned with contemporary society’s rising inequalities and environmental failings and is looking for a more constructive, balanced and thoughtful direction.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTIlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Defining Moments,Rita Burgett-Martell,,,,"There are moments in life when change creates the opportunity for you to take a different path. The choices you see and the decisions you make in those moments define the future course and direction of your life. You have a second chance to become what you might have been, if you had made different choices. Often, however, the fear of change will prevent you from seizing the moment to create the life you desire. In Defining Moments, the author provides personal examples and proven techniques that will inspire and prepare you to evaluate what's important to you now, and explore the option of choosing a new path that will lead to a life that is a more fulfilling life for you. After reading this book, you will see choices you didn't see before, feel confidence you didn't feel before and be ready to take actions you haven't had the courage to take to create the life you desire. Lack of clarity, limiting beliefs and fear of change will no longer prevent you from experiencing the life you were meant to live. Defining Moments is divided into three main sections: Part One: ""Achieving Clarity: What Do I Really Want?"" includes chapters on Change, Choices, Vision and Values. Part Two: ""Preparing for Success: Breaking Through Barriers,"" includes chapters on Beliefs, Decisions and Relationships. Part Three: ""Embracing the Future Waiting for You: How to Create the Life You Want,"" includes chapters on Action, Power, Expectations and Transformation. Defining Moments also includes an Appendix where all exercises and thought-provoking questions are compiled in one section that the reader can use as a workbook. The practical guidance Rita provides is based on her professional experience as an international organizational change consultant to Fortune 500 clients and career coach to more than 11,000 individuals, plus her own experience of taking the road less traveled to embrace the unknown and reinvent her life.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yWc9rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

A Way of Life,Judith Farquhar,Medical,,,"A short and thoughtful introduction to traditional Chinese medicine that looks beyond the conventional boundaries of Western modernism and biomedical science Traditional Chinese medicine is often viewed as mystical or superstitious, with outcomes requiring naïve faith. Judith Farquhar, drawing on her hard-won knowledge of social, intellectual, and clinical spheres in today's China, here offers a concise and nuanced treatment that addresses enduring and troublesome ontological, epistemological, and ethical questions. In this work, which is based on her 2017 Terry Lectures, ""Reality, Reason, and Action In and Beyond Chinese Medicine,"" she considers how the modern, rationalized, and scientific field of traditional Chinese medicine constructs its very real objects (bodies, symptoms, drugs), how experts think through and sort out pathology and health (yinyang, right qi / wrong qi, stasis, flow), and how contemporary doctors act responsibly to ""seek out the root"" of bodily disorder. Through this refined investigation, East-West contrasts collapse, and systematic Chinese medicine, no longer a mystery or a pseudo-science, can become a philosophical ally and a rich resource for a more capacious science.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Oe_RDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Story of Life,"Catherine Barr, Steve Williams",,,,"At first, nothing lived on Earth. It was a noisy, hot, scary place. Choking gas exploded from volcanoes and oceans of lava bubbled around the globe... Then in the deep, dark ocean, something amazing happened. This is an exciting and dramatic story about how life began and developed on Planet Earth, written especially for younger children. The authors explain how the first living cell was created, and how the cells multiply and create jellyfish and worms, and then fish with bendy necks, which drag themselves out of the water into swampy forests. They tell the story of the biggest creatures that have ever walked on land - the dinosaurs. Long after that, hairy creatures who have babies, not eggs, take over, stand on two legs and spread around the world, some of them living through cataclysmic events such as ice ages and volcanic eruptions. Everyone living today is related to these survivors. With delightful illustrations including lots of detail and humour, all carefully researched and checked, this book shows the development of life on Earth in a truly accessible and simple way.

DNA,"James D. Watson, Andrew Berry",Science,,5,"Fifty years ago, James D. Watson, then just twentyfour, helped launch the greatest ongoing scientific quest of our time. Now, with unique authority and sweeping vision, he gives us the first full account of the genetic revolution—from Mendel’s garden to the double helix to the sequencing of the human genome and beyond. Watson’s lively, panoramic narrative begins with the fanciful speculations of the ancients as to why “like begets like” before skipping ahead to 1866, when an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first deduced the basic laws of inheritance. But genetics as we recognize it today—with its capacity, both thrilling and sobering, to manipulate the very essence of living things—came into being only with the rise of molecular investigations culminating in the breakthrough discovery of the structure of DNA, for which Watson shared a Nobel prize in 1962. In the DNA molecule’s graceful curves was the key to a whole new science. Having shown that the secret of life is chemical, modern genetics has set mankind off on a journey unimaginable just a few decades ago. Watson provides the general reader with clear explanations of molecular processes and emerging technologies. He shows us how DNA continues to alter our understanding of human origins, and of our identities as groups and as individuals. And with the insight of one who has remained close to every advance in research since the double helix, he reveals how genetics has unleashed a wealth of possibilities to alter the human condition—from genetically modified foods to genetically modified babies—and transformed itself from a domain of pure research into one of big business as well. It is a sometimes topsy-turvy world full of great minds and great egos, driven by ambitions to improve the human condition as well as to improve investment portfolios, a world vividly captured in these pages. Facing a future of choices and social and ethical implications of which we dare not remain uninformed, we could have no better guide than James Watson, who leads us with the same bravura storytelling that made The Double Helix one of the most successful books on science ever published. Infused with a scientist’s awe at nature’s marvels and a humanist’s profound sympathies, DNA is destined to become the classic telling of the defining scientific saga of our age.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q_ogPf96O28C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

A Fragile Life,Todd May,Philosophy,24.6 EUR,,"“His discussion of the ways in which those who try to make themselves invulnerable . . . undermine what makes us most human, is clear and bracing.” —Los Angeles Review of Books In a moving examination of life and the trials that beset it, Todd May shows that our fragility, our ability to suffer, is actually one of the most important aspects of our humanity. May starts with a simple but hard truth: suffering is inevitable. At the most basic level, we suffer physically—a sprained ankle or a bad back. But we also suffer insults and indifference. We suffer from overburdened schedules and unforeseen circumstances, from moral dilemmas and emotional heartaches. Even just thinking about our own mortality—the fact that we only live one life—can lead us to tremendous suffering. No wonder philosophies such as Buddhism, Taoism, Stoicism, and even Epicureanism—all of which counsel us to rise above these plights—have had appeal over the centuries. May highlights the tremendous value of these philosophies and the ways they can guide us toward better lives, but he also exposes a major drawback to their tenets: such invulnerability is too emotionally disengaged from the world, leading us to place too great a distance between ourselves and our experience. Rather than seeking absolute immunity, he argues most of us just want to hurt less and learn how to embrace and accept what suffering we do endure in a meaningful way. Offering a guide on how to positively engage suffering, May ultimately lays out a new way of thinking about how we exist in the world.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YNcZDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The LIFE Pocket Guide to Digital Photography,The Editors of LIFE Books,Photography,,,"When LIFE published the first edition of this book in 2010, Scott Kelby, Editor-in-Chief of Photoshop User magazine (and a guru in the world of digital shooting), wrote, ""Joe McNally has put together the LIFE Guide to Digital Photography, which is packed full of tips, tricks, how-to, and beautiful pictures from Joe's thirty-plus-year photo career. If you've ever experienced one of Joe's workshops or seminars, you know he's a fantastic teacher, and this book is an extension of that. While he does write about the basics of photography, if you know Joe, you know that he's found a way to work his own sense of humor and familiarity in with all the nuts and bolts to make it an entertaining read."" Thousands of photo fans agreed, and eagerly joined Joe on his happy journey through the pixelated world of modern-day photography. In so doing, they learned from one of LIFE's master shooters-in fact, the final in the long line of distinguished LIFE staff photographers-who encouraged them that, with a little preparation and care, with a dash of enthusiasm and daring, anyone can make a better photo: Anyone can turn a ""keeper"" into a treasure. It has since become clear to Joe and the editors of LIFE that their Guide to Digital Photography was built to last-that its tips and tone had struck a chord with photography enthusiasts everywhere. One thing it wasn't, however, was built to fit in your camera bag when you were heading into the field. Now it is! Here's the digest-sized version, filled with the same wonderful collection of McNally photography, beautifully illustrating the points Joe is making. Everything you need to know about light and lenses, about color or composition, is in these pages. And now, when you're just about to click and you wonder ""What would Joe advise?"" the answer is at your fingertips.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JcF8tgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Separated at Birth,SHANA. GRANDERSON A. LADY,Fiction,,,"Fate places both the Darcy and Bennet parents at the Bell Inn in Stilton on the 5th day of March 1790. Both ladies are pregnant, and both have gone into premature labour. Thomas Bennet and Robert Darcy meet while their wives are labouring. As the two become acquainted, bonding over their shared love of the written word among other things, Darcy shares that his wife has had multiple miscarriages and stillbirths and his belief that if it is another stillbirth his beloved Lady Anne will not survive. Bennet shares that his eldest daughter, Jane, is home being looked after by his mother and his worry as his wife was much larger than she had been when she carried his daughter coupled with her labours beginning early. Robert Darcy passes out from over imbibing brandy and to relax and relieve his tension, Mr. Bennet takes a walk outside. When Bennet returns, the midwife tells him that both ladies have given birth. His Fanny, who he is deeply in love with, has birthed twins, but the second one was stillborn. The other lady, he is told, birthed a healthy daughter. The Bennets depart two days later to take Elizabeth Rose home and to bury their second daughter, who they named Lydia. The second twin was of fair complexion and blond while Lizzy darker, and dark curly hair like her Grandmother Beth. Like her grandmother and namesake, Lizzy has a distinctive birthmark on her left hand. It is obvious from the story that the daughter the Darcys return to Pemberley with is in fact the Bennet's second twin. She is named Beth-Anne and as the 'miracle babe' who saved her mother from depression or worse, she is very much indulged and not often corrected. One of the questions the story answers is who separated the twins? Was it Thomas Bennet in an act of compassion, the midwife, or was it Robert Darcy to save his wife from the heartbreak of another stillborn child? Of course, at some point the twins will meet. The question is how is the truth uncovered and how will each of the sisters react, especially as they are identical twins. Many of the characters we know are present along with some not in canon.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gaF8zwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Tackling Toxicity,Mauricio Velasquez,Business & Economics,,,"For the Toxic People in your life (work, home) and those related toxic experiences, this book was written to skill you up, empower you to deal with these toxic situations, toxic moments in your life. Enough being on the sidelines - go from bystander to upstander. No longer will you regret later - ""oh I should have said something or done something."" Also a great gift - give this book (anonymously if you have to) to that bully, narcissist, difficult person in your life. As the author, I bring all of my experiences over my 30 year career as a Management Consultant, Workplace Investigator, Executive Coach, Trainer and Expert Witness specializing in bias, prejudice and hate. All too often, I was hired to intervene where parties were not engaging each other and I was hired to come in and address the toxic conflict behavior pattern. For that toxic bully, for that narcissist micromanager boss, for that jerk, for that difficult family member (mother-in-law?) - I will give you skills, tools, a script so to speak of what to say or do, how to, and when to engage the toxic behaviors and the toxic person. So many books are about being more ""self-aware"" - raising your own self-awareness but they don't equip you, skill you up, give you specific, relevant and impactful tips and tools to truly make a difference in your life. Learn how to stand up for yourself - especially when others are present and say nothing to support you.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qPv_0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Pounding Down... One Day at a Time,Ruth A. Manieri,Self-Help,,,"Having dealt with weight loss over many years, I decided to write my thoughts about such in the form of poetry. Many hours were spent compiling suitable information and writing my thoughts about dieting and weight loss. I tried to pinpoint specific areas that I found to be troublesome and challenging. I thought that a person might find it easier to read a poem with some specific meaning for a day's diet routine rather than a lengthy article. Hence my idea of a poetry book about a weight loss theme. I also wanted to offer this book as a keepsake of a job well done so a person, can record their thoughts and meal plans for each day's effort in the weight loss struggle.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kLwTqAs4h3gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Comparison of Martin's Empirical Correlation with Measurements on a Compact Plate Heat Exchanger,Abdulmohsen A. Alothman,Heat exchangers,,,"The need for more effective heat exchangers is becoming more necessary these days. At the same time, the size of the heat exchanger also plays a big role. Therefore, in many applications the compact plate heat exchanger is used where high effectiveness and small size are required. As a result, it is necessary to study and understand the performance of compact plate heat exchangers. More specifically, the performance of heat transfer, represent by the Colburn factor j, and friction factor f, must be deeply studied and understood. A mathematical model has been built to express f and j factors based on existing correlations. Also, experimental results have been obtained and compared with the analytical model. It was found that Martin's correlation of finding friction and Colburn factors are not in agreement with the experimental results for a compact heat exchanger. Therefore, the findings show that compactness has an effect on performance, and that the j and f factors should be modified in the future to reflect this.",
