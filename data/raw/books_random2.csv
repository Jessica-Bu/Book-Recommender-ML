The Battle of Life Annotated,Charles Dickens,,,,"The Battle of Life: A Love Story is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in 1846. It is the fourth of his five ""Christmas Books"", coming after The Cricket on the Hearth and followed by The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain.The setting is an English village that stands on the site of an historic battle. Some characters refer to the battle as a metaphor for the struggles of life, hence the title.Battle is the only one of the five Christmas Books that has no supernatural or explicitly religious elements. (One scene takes place at Christmas time, but it is not the final scene.) The story bears some resemblance to The Cricket on the Hearth in two respects: it has a non-urban setting, and it is resolved with a romantic twist. It is even less of a social novel than is Cricket. As is typical with Dickens, the ending is a happy one.It is one of Dickens's lesser-known works and has never attained any high level of popularity - a trait it shares among the Christmas Books with The Haunted Man.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=os6xywEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Life Histories,"Martin Thiel, Gary A. Wellborn",Science,153.52 EUR,,"Crustaceans are increasingly being used as model organisms in all fields of biology, including neurobiology, developmental biology, animal physiology, evolutionary ecology, biogeography, and resource management. Crustaceans have a very wide range of phenotypes and inhabit a diverse array of environments, ranging from the deep sea to high mountain lakes and even deserts. The evolution of their life histories has permitted crustaceans to successfully colonize this variety of habitats. Few other taxa exhibit such a variety of life histories and behavior. A comprehensive overview of their life histories is essential to the understanding of many aspects of their success in marine and terrestrial environments. This volume provides a general overview of crustacean life histories. Crustaceans have particular life history adaptations that have permitted them to conquer all environments on earth. Crustacean life cycles have evolved to maximize fecundity, growth, and ageing, in a wide range of environmental conditions. Individual contributions contrast benefits and costs of different life histories including sexual versus asexual production, semelparity versus iteroparity, and planktonic larvae versus direct development. Important aspects of particular behaviors are presented (e.g. migrations, defense and territorial behaviors, anti-predator behavior, symbiosis).",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NxRbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Simply Feel Good,Dr Samuel C Foster,,,,"What I'm Going to Tell You in This Book Will Change Your Life You're going to find the last piece of the puzzle that will unlock your success, fulfilment, and pleasure. I was lost a few years ago. Frustrated, Scared, Unsure, Anxious, Trapped, Unfulfilled. In a job that is a dead end, expectations of society suffocate me. I lacked a clear idea of what I wanted to accomplish with my life. I had the self-respect to want to make changes in my life, but I had no idea where to begin. I spent my days hoping for a change in the status quo so I could leave the existence my spirit could no longer support. The hardest thing was that I was following the example society has always set for me. It's simpler than you ever could have thought a secret you've known all your life but kept hidden from view. And once you realize what it is and start utilizing it, nothing in your life will ever be the same. It's time to stop waiting. The happiness you've always desired may now be yours at last. It's time to provide you with a strategy for your success. Now is the moment for you to SIMPLY FEEL GOOD.

Biodeconstruction,Francesco Vitale,Philosophy,31.74 EUR,,"In Biodeconstruction, Francesco Vitale demonstrates the key role that the question of life plays in Jacques Derrida's work. In the seminar La vie la mort (1975), Derrida engages closely with the life sciences, especially biology and evolution theory. Connecting this line of thought to his analysis of cybernetics in Of Grammatology, Vitale shows how Derrida develops a notion of biological life as itself a sort of text that is necessarily open onto further articulations and grafts. This sets the stage for the deconstruction of the traditional opposition between life and death, conceiving of death as an internal condition of the constitution of the living rather than being the opposite of life. It also provides the basis for the deconstruction of the rigidly deterministic concept of the genetic program, an insight that anticipates recent achievements of biological research in epigenetics and sexual reproduction. Finally, Vitale argues that this framework can enrich our understanding of Derrida's late work devoted to political issues, connecting his use of the autoimmunitarian lexicon to the theory of cellular suicide in biology.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sDJNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Life and Death in Shanghai,Nien Cheng,,,,"This is a first-hand account of China's cultural revolution. Nien Cheng, an anglophile and fluent English-speaker who worked for Shell in Shanghai under Mao, was put under house arrest by Red Guards in 1966 and subsequently jailed. All attempts to make her confess to the charges of being a British spy failed; all efforts to indoctrinate her were met by a steadfast and fearless refusal to accept the terms offered by her interrogators. When she was released from prison she was told that her daughter had committed suicide. In fact Meiping had been beaten to death by Maoist revolutionaries.",
Dalai Lama,Mayank Chhaya,Buddhism,,4,"The current and 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, inspires perennial fascination. Longstanding exile, religious leader,accomplished writer and skilful diplomat, his many guises seem only to add to his mystique. Who is the real Dalai Lama,and what are the true motivations which drive this simultaneously personable and deeply enigmatic man, considered by his followers to be the living embodiment of the Bodhisattva of Compassion? In a revealing, richly anecdotal, and thoroughly researched biography, Mayank Chhaya strips away the multiple layers of the Dalai Lama's personality to getto the man behind the public face. Adding depth and nuance to his portrait, which is based on many personal interviews,the author depicts the Dalai Lama in the light of his banishment and forced flight from his homeland, uncovering the various contexts which have shaped his subject's beliefs, politics and ideals. Shedding fresh light on the complexities of the relationship between China and Tibet, Chhaya also discusses the growing frustrations of young Tibetans with thenonviolent approach to Chinese occupation advocated by the Dalai Lama. The result is a compelling profile of aremarkable spiritual leader and an engaging picture of how the current unrest in his country will determine its long-termfuture.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_hpHPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

John Stuart Mill and the Art of Life,"Ben Eggleston, Dale Miller, David Weinstein",Philosophy,,,"The 'Art of Life' is John Stuart Mill's name for his account of practical reason. In this volume, eleven leading scholars elucidate this fundamental, but widely neglected, element of Mill's thought. Mill divides the Art of Life into three 'departments': 'Morality, Prudence or Policy, and Æsthetics'. In the volume's first section, Rex Martin, David Weinstein, Ben Eggleston, and Dale E. Miller investigate the relation between the departments of morality and prudence. Their papers ask whether Mill is a rule utilitarian and, if so, whether his practical philosophy must be incoherent. The second section contains papers by Jonathan Riley and Wendy Donner, who explore the relation between the departments of morality and aesthetics. They discuss issues ranging from supererogation to aesthetic pleasure and humanity's relationship with nature. The papers in the third section consider the Art of Life's axiological first principle, the principle of utility. Elijah Millgram contends that Mill's own life refutes his claim that the Art of Life has a single axiological first principle. Philip Kitcher maintains that Mill has a dynamic axiology requiring us to continually refine our conception of the good. In the final section, three papers address what it means to put the Art of Life into practice. Robert Haraldsson locates an 'Art of Ethics' in On Liberty that is in tension with the Art of Life. Nadia Urbinati plumbs the classical roots of Mill's view of the good life. Finally, Colin Heydt develops Mill's suggestion that we regard our own lives as works of art.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7kBc3MLx0VEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
Microbial Life History,Steven A. Frank,Science,51.36 EUR,,"A powerful framework for understanding how natural selection shapes adaptation and biological design Design and diversity are the two great challenges in the study of life. Microbial Life History draws on the latest advances in microbiology to describe the fundamental forces of biological design and apply these evolutionary processes to a broad diversity of traits in microbial metabolism and biochemistry. Emphasizing how to formulate and test hypotheses of adaptation, Steven Frank provides a new foundation for exploring the evolutionary forces of design. He discusses the economic principles of marginal valuations, trade-offs, and payoffs in risky and random environments; the social aspects of conflict and cooperation; the demographic aspects of age and spatial heterogeneity; and the engineering control theory principles by which systems adjust to environments. Frank then applies these evolutionary principles to the biochemistry of microbial metabolism, providing the first comprehensive link between the forces that shape biological design and cellular energetics. Tracing how natural selection sculpts metabolism, Microbial Life History provides new perspectives on the life histories of organisms, from growth rate and survival to dispersal and defense against attack. Along the way, this incisive book addresses the conceptual and philosophical challenges confronting evolutionary biologists and other practitioners who study biological design and seek to apply its lessons.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ieZfEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Forsters writing, from approximately 1903 to 1958, and shows Forster at every phase of his writing career. Forster, feeling his career would suffer, never sought publication for most of the stories, hiding these away along with Maurice, his novel of homosexual love. With stories that are lively and amusing (What Does It Matter; The Obelisk), as well as more somber and deft portrayals of love, truth, and society (Dr Woolacott; Arthur Snatchfold), The Life to Come sheds a light on Forsters powerful but suppressed explorations beyond the strictures of conventional society.",

Suffering and the Christian Life,Rachel Davies,Religion,36.44 EUR,,"This volume approaches questions concerning the status and meaning of suffering in Christian life and Christian theology through the lens of a variety of theological disciplines – biblical, historical, practical, political and systematic theology. Scholars from this range of fields concentrate on a number of questions: Is love intrinsically linked with suffering? Are suffering and loss on some level fundamentally good? How is – and how should – suffering and diminishment be viewed in the Christian tradition? Featuring leading voices that include Linn Tonstad, Bernard McGinn, Anna Rowlands, John Swinton and Paul Murray, this volume brings together essays touching on concrete issues such as cancer, mental health, and the experience of refugees, and discusses broad themes including vulnerability, kenosis and tragedy. In correlating these themes with the examination of texts ranging from Paul's letters to works of the Cappadocians, Thomas Aquinas, John of the Cross and Mother Teresa, Suffering and the Christian Life offers fresh and accessible academic approaches to a question of vital personal, existential significance.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fR20DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Hurdles,Dennis St. Rose,Biography & Autobiography,4.27 EUR,,"Life is like a journey into uncharted waters where mankind is constantly attempting to navigate the ship of life through the seas of uncertainty. On this voyage, we are not sure if the worldliness we experience in the continuum between birth and death is real or if it is a figment of our imagination. If it is indeed the latter, the question then becomes how or when this phenomenon of our existence will ever be revealed. If the answer to this question is never, we are then thrown into a state of perpetual confusion at the core of which lies the questions Who are we? and Why are we here? I write this book not because I have the answers to any of these questions but because I believe that by chronicling my experiences, my children, family members, friends, and others who may read it will become more introspective in the living of their lives. No person can write their complete autobiography in advance, but I have tried to select events that, at this point in time, I consider to have had the greatest impact on my life.

"Scenes of Clerical Life, Vol. I",Mary Anne Evans,Fiction,,,"In 'Scenes of Clerical Life, Vol. I,' Mary Anne Evans, under the famed pseudonym George Eliot, weaves a delicate tapestry of provincial life in 19th-century England. Had it not been explicitly mentioned, one might scarce believe that the vibrant spectrum of clerical figures populating these tales springs from a single pen, such is the diversity of their temperaments and foibles. Enriched by a deft blend of humor and pathos, Evans employs a pioneering realism, which situates her literary endeavor within the larger context of Victorian fiction. By overriding the era's penchant for the romantic and the sensational, Evans infuses her narratives with a nuanced exploration of the moral and social issues confronting ordinary individuals within their community, crafting a work of enduring significance and subtlety. As a woman of remarkable intellect and insight, Mary Anne Evans adopted a male pen name to ensure her works were taken seriously in a time when female authors were often relegated to writing lightweight romances. Her profound understanding of human nature is evident in the complex characters and intricate relationships that form the crux of this book. This understanding, coupled with experiences derived from her own life in rural England and her voracious appetite for scholarly pursuits, renders 'Scenes of Clerical Life' an authentic and poignant study of the human condition. 'Scenes of Clerical Life, Vol. I' is recommended for readers who relish in the exploration of the social mores and the quiet, yet resounding dramas that unfold in the seemingly mundane. It is a testament to Evans's literary genius and to her pioneering role in shaping the novel as a mirror to life's intricate realities. This volume, replete with Evan's rich prose and keen psychological insights, is a brilliant starting point for those embarking on the journey through her oeuvre.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=en1_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Battle of Life Illustrated,Charles Dickens,,,,"The Battle of Life: A Love Story is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in 1846. It is the fourth of his five ""Christmas Books"", coming after The Cricket on the Hearth and followed by The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain.The setting is an English village that stands on the site of an historic battle. Some characters refer to the battle as a metaphor for the struggles of life, hence the title.Battle is the only one of the five Christmas Books that has no supernatural or explicitly religious elements. (One scene takes place at Christmas time, but it is not the final scene.) The story bears some resemblance to The Cricket on the Hearth in two respects: it has a non-urban setting, and it is resolved with a romantic twist. It is even less of a social novel than is Cricket. As is typical with Dickens, the ending is a happy one.It is one of Dickens's lesser-known works and has never attained any high level of popularity - a trait it shares among the Christmas Books with The Haunted Man.",
Child Life in Town and Country,Anatole France,Fiction,0.49 EUR,,"In ""Child Life in Town and Country,"" Anatole France presents a richly textured exploration of childhood experiences, both in urban and rural settings. This work, written in a style that marries lyrical prose with thoughtful observation, explores the joys and struggles faced by children navigating the complexities of their environments. France utilizes a blend of anecdotal narratives and philosophical musings, drawing upon the contrasts between the stimulating vibrancy of city life and the pastoral simplicity of the countryside, to delve into the inherent innocence and authenticity of youth. The book reflects the broader literary context of late 19th-century France, where there was a growing interest in social issues and the depiction of childhood as both a delicate and formative stage of life. Anatole France, a Nobel Laureate in Literature, was known for his profound insights into human nature and society. Having experienced both the hustle of Paris and the tranquility of rural France, his personal background deeply informed his writing. His keen observations of social dynamics and a pervasive sense of nostalgia for the innocence of youth resonate throughout this work, drawing from his own upbringing and the cultural milieu of a rapidly industrializing France. This book is a timeless portrait that holds relevance for educators, parents, and anyone interested in the sociology of childhood. France'Äôs nuanced perspectives invite readers to reflect on the duality of children's experiences while challenging assumptions about their development across different environments. ""Child Life in Town and Country"" is essential reading for those who seek to understand the interplay between innocence and the societal structures that shape young lives.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ne_EDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

With contributions from leading historians in the field, Volume 5, Part Two paints a complex portrait of a dynasty beset by problems and contradictions, but one which, despite its military and geopolitical weakness, was nevertheless economically powerful, culturally brilliant, socially fluid and the most populous of any empire in global history to that point. In this much anticipated addition to the series, the authors survey key themes across ten chapters, including government, economy, society, religion, and thought to provide an authoritative and topical treatment of a profound and significant period in Chinese history.",

Fallen Glory,James Crawford,Architecture,,,"“A narrative that spans seven millennia, five continents and even reaches into cyberspace. . . . I savored each page.” —Henry Petroski, Wall Street Journal In Fallen Glory, James Crawford uncovers the biographies of some of the world’s most fascinating lost and ruined buildings, from the dawn of civilization to the cyber era. The lives of these iconic structures are packed with drama and intrigue, featuring war and religion, politics and art, love and betrayal, catastrophe and hope. They provide the stage for a startling array of characters, including Gilgamesh, the Cretan Minotaur, Agamemnon, Nefertiti, Genghis Khan, Henry VIII, Catherine the Great, Adolf Hitler, and even Bruce Springsteen. The twenty-one structures Crawford focuses on include The Tower of Babel, The Temple of Jerusalem, The Library of Alexandria, The Bastille, Kowloon Walled City, the Berlin Wall, and the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Ranging from the deserts of Iraq, the banks of the Nile and the cloud forests of Peru, to the great cities of Jerusalem, Istanbul, Paris, Rome, London and New York, Fallen Glory is a unique guide to a world of vanished architecture. And, by picking through the fragments of our past, it asks what history’s scattered ruins can tell us about our own future. “Witty and memorable . . . moving as well as myth-busting.” —Times Literary Supplement (UK) “[An] elegant, charged book . . .

A History of the Spanish Lexicon,Steven N. Dworkin,Language Arts & Disciplines,73.39 EUR,,"This history of the Spanish lexicon is written from the interacting perspectives of linguistic and cultural change and in the light of advances in the study of language contact and lexical change. The author describes the language inherited from spoken Latin in the Iberian Peninsula during six centuries of Roman occupation and examines the degree to which it imported words from the languages - of which only Basque survives - of pre-Roman Spain. He then shows how Germanic words were imported either indirectly through Latin or Old French or directly by contact with the Visigoths. He describes the importation of Arabisms following the eighth-century Arab conquest of Spain, distinguishing those documented in medieval sources from those adopted for everyday use, many of which survive in modern Spanish. He considers the influence of Old French and Old Provençal and identifies late direct and indirect borrowings from Latin, including the Italian elements taken up during the Renaissance. After outlining minor influences from languages such as Flemish, Portuguese, and Catalan, Professor Dworkin examines the effects on the lexicon of contact between Spanish and the indigenous languages of South and Central America, and the impact of contact with English. The book is aimed at advanced students and scholars of Spanish linguistics and will interest specialists in Hispanic literary and cultural studies.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LQJREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Communist Pigs,Thomas Fleischman,History,,,"The pig played a fundamental role in the German Democratic Republic?s attempts to create and sustain a modern, industrial food system built on communist principles. By the mid-1980s, East Germany produced more pork per capita than West Germany and the UK, while also suffering myriad unintended consequences of this centrally planned practice: manure pollution, animal disease, and rolling food shortages. The pig is an incredibly adaptive animal, and historian Thomas Fleischman uncovers three types of pig that played roles in this history: the industrial pig, remade to suit the conditions of factory farming; the wild boar, whose overpopulation was a side effect of agricultural development rather than a conservation success story; and the garden pig, reflective of the regime?s growing acceptance of private, small-scale farming within the planned economy. Fleischman chronicles East Germany?s journey from family farms to factory farms, explaining how communist principles shaped the adoption of industrial agriculture practices. More broadly, Fleischman argues that agriculture under communism came to reflect standard practices of capitalist agriculture, and that the pork industry provides a clear illustration of this convergence. His analysis sheds light on the causes of the country?s environmental and political collapse in 1989 and offers a warning about the high cost of cheap food in the present and future.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j6vqywEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
The Hidden History of the Tibetan Book of the Dead,Department of Religion Florida State University Bryan J. Cuevas Assistant Professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies,Religion,,,"In 1927, Oxford University Press published the first western-language translation of a collection of Tibetan funerary texts (the Great Liberation upon Hearing in the Bardo) under the title The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Since that time, the work has established a powerful hold on the western popular imagination, and is now considered a classic of spiritual literature. Over the years, The Tibetan Book of the Dead has inspired numerous commentaries, an illustrated edition, a play, a video series, and even an opera. Translators, scholars, and popular devotees of the book have claimed to explain its esoteric ideas and reveal its hidden meaning. Few, however, have uttered a word about its history. Bryan J. Cuevas seeks to fill this gap in our knowledge by offering the first comprehensive historical study of the Great Liberation upon Hearing in the Bardo, and by grounding it firmly in the context of Tibetan history and culture. He begins by discussing the many ways the texts have been understood (and misunderstood) by westerners, beginning with its first editor, the Oxford-educated anthropologist Walter Y. Evans-Wentz, and continuing through the present day. The remarkable fame of the book in the west, Cuevas argues, is strikingly disproportionate to how the original Tibetan texts were perceived in their own country. Cuevas tells the story of how The Tibetan Book of the Dead was compiled in Tibet, of the lives of those who preserved and transmitted it, and explores the history of the rituals through which the life of the dead is imagined in Tibetan society. This book provides not only a fascinating look at a popular and enduring spiritual work, but also a much-needed corrective to the proliferation of ahistorical scholarship surrounding The Tibetan Book of the Dead.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M0T5WNMY1ZUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Iceland's 1100 Years,Gunnar Karlsson,,,,"'Iceland's 1100 Years' recounts the history of a society on the margin of Europe as well as on the margin of reaching the size and wealth of a proper state. Iceland is unique among the European societies in being founded as late as the Viking Age, and in surviving for centuries without any central power after Christianity had introduced the art of writing. This was the age of the Sagas, which are not only literature but also a rare treasury of sources about a stateless society.In sharp contrast to the prosperous society portrayed by the Sagas, early modern Iceland appears to have been extremely poor and miserable. It is challenging to question whether the deterioration was due to foreign rule, to a colder climate, or to an unfortunate internal power structure.Or was the Golden Age perhaps the invention of 19th-century nationalists? Iceland adopted nationalism quickly and thoroughly. In the mid-nineteenth century about 60,000 inhabitants, mostly poor peasants, set out to gain independence from Denmark, which was finally achieved in 1944 with the foundation of a republic. In recent decades Iceland has caught up economically with its closest neighbours. This has come about mainly through the mechanisation of fishing, which gave rise to a second battle for sovereignty, this time over the country's fishing grounds.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AQh1swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Workers Across the Americas,Leon Fink,Business & Economics,,,"The first major volume to place U.S.-centered labor history in a transnational focus, Workers Across the Americas collects the newest scholarship of Canadianist, Caribbeanist, and Latin American specialists as well as U.S. historians. These essays highlight both the supra- and sub-national aspect of selected topics without neglecting nation-states themselves as historical forces. Indeed, the transnational focus opens new avenues for understanding changes in the concepts, policies, and practice of states, their interactions with each other and their populations, and the ways in which the popular classes resist, react, and advance their interests.What does this transnational turn encompass? And what are its likely perils as well as promise as a framework for research and analysis? To address these questions John French, Julie Greene, Neville Kirk, Aviva Chomsky, Dirk Hoerder, and Vic Satzewich lead off the volume with critical commentaries on the project of transnational labor history. Their responses offer a tour of explanations, tensions, and cautions in the evolution of a new arena of research and writing. Thereafter, Workers Across the Americas groups fifteen research essays around themes of labor and empire, indigenous peoples and labor systems, international feminism and reproductive labor, labor recruitment and immigration control, transnational labor politics, and labor internationalism. Topics range from military labor in the British Empire to coffee workers on the Guatemalan/Mexican border to the role of the International Labor Organization in attempting to set common labor standards. Leading scholars introduce each section and recommend further reading.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yTg6YeE33NYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Biodiversity and Earth History,"Jens Boenigk, Sabina Wodniok, Edvard Glücksman",Science,,,"This uniquely interdisciplinary textbook explores the exciting and complex relationship between Earth’s geological history and the biodiversity of life. Its innovative design provides a seamless learning experience, clarifying major concepts step by step with detailed textual explanations complemented by detailed figures, diagrams and vibrant pictures. Thanks to its layout, the respective concepts can be studied individually, as part of the broader framework of each chapter, or as they relate to the book as a whole. It provides in-depth coverage of: - Earth’s formation and subsequent geological history, including patterns of climate change and atmospheric evolution; - The early stages of life, from microbial ‘primordial soup’ theories to the fossil record’s most valuable contributions; - Mechanisms of mutual influence between living organisms and the environment: how life changed Earth’s history whilst, at the same time, environmental pressures continue to shape the evolution of species; - Basic ideas in biodiversity studies: species concepts, measurement techniques, and global distribution patterns; - Biological systematics, from their historical origins in Greek philosophy and Biblical stories to Darwinian evolution by natural selection, and to phylogenetics based on cutting-edge molecular techniques. This book’s four major sections offer a fresh cross-disciplinary overview of biodiversity and the Earth’s history. Among many other concepts, they reveal the massive diversity of eukaryotes, explain the geological processes behind fossilisation, and provide an eye-opening account of the relatively short period of human evolution in the context of Earth’s 4.6 billion-year history. Employing a combination of proven didactic tools, the book is simultaneously a reading reference, illustrated guide, and encyclopaedia of organismal biology and geology. It is aimed at school- and university-level students, as well as members of the public fascinated by the intricate interrelationship of living organisms and their environment.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kfAzvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
Warrior Race,Lawrence James,History,,,"Modern Britain is a nation shaped by wars. The boundaries of its separate parts are the outcome of conquest and resistance. The essence of its identity are the warrior heroes, both real and imagined, who still capture the national imagination: from Boadicea to King Arthur, Rob Roy to Henry V, the Duke of Wellington to Winston Churchill. It is a sense of identity that grew under careful cultivation during the global struggles of the eighteenth century, and found its most powerful expression during the world wars of the twentieth. In Warrior Race, Lawrence James investigates the role played by war in the making of Britain. Drawing on the latest historical and archaeological research, as well as numerous unfamiliar and untapped resources, he charts the full reach of British military history: the physical and psychological impact of Roman military occupation; the monarchy's struggle for mastery of the British Isles; the civil wars of the seventeenth century; the ""total war"" experience of twentieth-century conflict. But Warrior Race is more than just a compelling historical narrative. Lawrence James skillfully pulls together the momentous themes of his subject. He discusses how war has continually been a catalyst for social and political change, the rise, survival, and reinvention of chivalry, the literary quest for a British epic, the concept of birth and breeding as the qualifications for command in war, and the issues of patriotism and Britain's antiwar tradition. Warrior Race is popular history at its very best: incisive, informative, and accessible; immaculately researched and hugely readable. Balancing the broad sweep of history with an acute attention to detail, Lawrence James never loses sight of this most fascinating and enduring of subjects: the question of British national identity and character.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Le4P4M6z2PYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In this rich, fascinating history, John Ghazvinian traces the complex story of the relations between these two nations back to the Persian Empire of the eighteenth century—the subject of great admiration by Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams—and an America seen by Iranians as an ideal to emulate for their own government. Drawing on years of archival research both in the United States and Iran—including access to Iranian government archives rarely available to Western scholars—the Iranian-born, Oxford-educated historian leads us through the four seasons of U.S.–Iran relations: the spring of mutual fascination; the summer of early interactions; the autumn of close strategic ties; and the long, dark winter of mutual hatred. Ghazvinian makes clear where, how, and when it all went wrong. America and Iran shows why two countries that once had such heartfelt admiration for each other became such committed enemies—and why it didn’t have to turn out this way.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TkfCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Voice and Vision,Stephen J. Pyne,Language Arts & Disciplines,32.05 EUR,,"It has become commonplace these days to speak of “unpacking” texts. Voice and Vision is a book about packing that prose in the first place. While history is scholarship, it is also art—that is, literature. And while it has no need to emulate fiction, slump into memoir, or become self-referential text, its composition does need to be conscious and informed. Voice and Vision is for those who wish to understand the ways in which literary considerations can enhance nonfiction writing. At issue is not whether writing is scholarly or popular, narrative or analytical, but whether it is good. Fiction has guidebooks galore; journalism has shelves stocked with manuals; certain hybrids such as creative nonfiction and the new journalism have evolved standards, esthetics, and justifications for how to transfer the dominant modes of fiction to topics in nonfiction. But history and other serious or scholarly nonfiction have nothing comparable. Now this curious omission is addressed by Stephen Pyne as he analyzes and teaches the craft that undergirds whole realms of nonfiction and book-based academic disciplines. With eminent good sense concerning the unique problems posed by research-based writing and with a wealth of examples from accomplished writers, Pyne, an experienced and skilled writer himself, explores the many ways to understand what makes good nonfiction, and explains how to achieve it. His counsel and guidance will be invaluable to experts as well as novices in the art of writing serious and scholarly nonfiction.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=To0sz9jqNfYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

They were unaware that Washington Irving had invented the man entirely and placed the ads himself. Knickerbocker's purported manuscript, A History of New York, was Irving's own. Told from Knickerbocker's point of view, A History of New York is a chronicle of New York's fifty years under Dutch rule in the 1600s that plays fast and loose with the facts, to uproarious effect. A History of New York propelled Irving to the heights of literary stardom.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3JTazQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Models of the History of Philosophy: From its Origins in the Renaissance to the ‘Historia Philosophica’,Giovanni Santinello,Philosophy,,,"Models of the History of Philosophy. From its Origins in the Renaissance to the `Historia philosophica' (a translation of a work published in 1981 in Italian - the bibliography has been updated) gives a comprehensive description of the various forms and approaches in the literature of the history of philosophy from the fifteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century. Several traditions are described, from the well known `prisca theologia' and `perennis philosophia' traditions of Marsilio Ficino and Augustino Steuco, which claimed that the Greeks got their philosophy from the East, to the unknown influence of Scepticism on the history of philosophy by the recovery of Sextus Empiricus, and the German Protestant critical attack on Greek philosophy as Atheistic which was the tradition of the history of philosophy out of which Leibniz developed. Each individual historian of philosophy is given a separate entry which includes a biography, a complete bibliography of his works, a description of his history of philosophy and ends with both an assessment of his reputation during his own time and a complete listing of recent literature on him. As a result the substantial variety in the way the history of philosophy was written and, with it, an overview of the way western civilization developed is described in detail for the first time. For university history of literature, history of culture, history of religion and history of philosophy classes. The book can be used both for undergraduate courses (for specific reading assignments) and as background material for graduate courses. The bibliography provides important aids to many topics which have previously been almost inaccessible.",

The Rosary,Franz Michel William,,,,"PART ONE of this book presents the first complete history of the origin and development of the rosary. This prayer has grown like a spreading shrub. Springing up lush and green in the spirirual soil of the Irish-British homeland, it extended to the continent. In Central Europe it blossomed forth in mysteries which finally attained perfection of form and number in Southern Europe. Part two is the story of the significance of the rosary in the light of its history. The great teachers are invoked as witnesses: they explain the nature of the prayer and tell of the various helps offered the faithful for the right understanding and proper practice of the devotion. Especially profitable for the aid and guidance of souls are the personal experiences of St. Louis Grignion de Montfort, canonized on July 20, 1947. THE ROSARY is like a mighty stream whose waters are drawn from many tributaries. They all have their source in the same spiritual heights-the liturgical prayers of the Church, not as directed to the celebration of the Holy Mass, but as establishing a prayerful relationship to God. F or this reason the history of the rosary should begin with a survey of those lofty regions of liturgical prayer. Then, following the course of these sacred streams as they converge to form the rosary, we descend into the valley of the faith.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ty4gnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Introduction to Social Psychology,Gary S. Nickell,,,,,
Rethinking Global Health,Rochelle A. Burgess,PSYCHOLOGY,,,"This book reflects and analyses the working of power in the field of global health- and what this goes on to produce. In so doing, Rethinking Global Health asks the pivotal questions of, 'who is global health for' and 'what is it that limits our ability to build responses that meet people where they are?' Covering a wide range of topics from global mental health to Ebola, this book combines power analyses with interviews and personal reflections spanning the author's decade-long career in global health. It interrogates how the search for global solutions can often end up far from where we anticipated. It also introduces readers to different frameworks for power analyses in the field, including an adaptation of the 'matrix of domination' for global health practice. Through this work, Dr Burgess develops a new model of Transformative Global Health, a framework that calls researchers and practitioners to adopt new orienting principles, placing community interests and voices at the heart of global health planning and solutions at all times. This book will be beneficial to students and academics working in the global and public health landscape. It will also hold appeal to activists, practitioners and individuals invested in the discipline and in health equity around the world.",
Life - As a Matter of Fat,Ole G. Mouritsen,Science,88.8 EUR,,"Presents a multi-disciplinary perspective on the physics of life and the particular role played by lipids and the lipid-bilayer component of cell membranes.

By combining and synthesizing insights obtained from a variety of recent studies, an attempt is made to clarify what membrane structure is and how it can be quantitatively described. Shows how biological function mediated by membranes is controlled by lipid membrane structure and organization on length scales ranging from the size of the individual molecule, across molecular assemblies of proteins and lipid domains in the range of nanometers, to the size of whole cells. Applications of lipids in nano-technology and biomedicine are also described.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3J9enifNNTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
A Drama in the Air,Jules Verne,,,,"A Drama in the Air Science for families: A Voyage in a Balloon by Jules Verne Amalgamating futuristic technologies and expeditions into the future, this is a scintillating collection by Verne. This short work combines sights of the future as well as bird's eye view of the contemporary era. Just as the narrator starts the ascent of his balloon, a stranger jumps into its car. The unexpected passenger's only intent is to take the balloon as high as it will go, even at the cost of his and pilot's life. The intruder takes advantage of the long journey to recount the history of incidents related to the epic of lighter-than-air travel. This short story foreshadows Verne's first novel, Five Weeks in a Balloon. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

Soon after she is released into the care of the local authority, Diamond has a 'proper' case to get his teeth into when a woman's body is found in the garden of a flat after a somewhat drunken party.

The Peloponnesian War,John Francis Lazenby,History,,,"The range and extent of the Peloponnesian War of the fifth century BC has led to it being described as a 'world war' in miniature. With the struggle between Athens and Sparta at its core, the twenty-seven-year conflict drew in states from all points of the compass; from Byzantion in the north, Crete in the south, Asia Minor in the east and Sicily in the west. Since Thucydides described the war as 'the greatest disturbance to befall the Greeks' numerous studies have been made of individual episodes and topics. This authoritative work is the first single-volume study of the entire war to be published in over seventy-five years. Lazenby avoids the tendency of allowing historiography to obscure the analysis, and while paying due attention to detail, also looks at the fundamental questions of warfare raised by the conflict. Within a narrative framework, Lazenby concentrates on the fighting itself, and examining the way in which both strategy and tactics developed as the conflict spread. Not afraid to challenge accepted views, he assesses the war as a military rather than a political endeavour, evaluating issues such as the advantages and limitations of sea power. A readable and clear survey, this text offers a balanced discussion of controversial themes, and will appeal to ancient historians, classicists and all those who are interested in military history.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYOTmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

What's the Least I Can Believe and Still be a Christian?,Martin Thielen,Religion,,,"Pastor and author Martin Thielen has compiled a list of ten things people need to believe, and ten things they don't, in order to be a Christian. This lively and engaging book will be a help to seekers as well as a comfort to believers who may find themselves questioning some of the assumptions they grew up with. With an accessible, storytelling style that's grounded in solid biblical scholarship, Thielen shows how Christians don't need to believe that sinners will be ""left behind"" to burn in hell or that it's heresy to believe in evolution. And while we must always take the Bible seriously, we don't always have to take it literally. At the same time, Christians do need to believe in Jesus--his life, his teachings, his death and resurrection, and his vision for the world. A great benefit of those beliefs is that they provide promising answers to life's most profound questions, including: Where is God? What matters most? What brings fulfillment? What about suffering? Is there hope? Thielen articulates centrist, mainline Christianity in a way that's fresh and easy to understand, and offers authentic Christian insights that speak to our deepest needs. This new edition includes a leader's guide, previously only available online, and a new introduction from the author that reflects on the book's reception. The leader's guide features unique and easily implemented aids for carrying out a seven-week, congregation-wide initiative that will help local churches reach out to their communities.

A Satire Anthology,Carolyn Wells,Poetry,,,"From the INTRODUCTION: SATIRE, though a form of literature familiar to everyone, is difficult to define. Partaking variously of sarcasm, irony, ridicule, and burlesque, it is exactly synonymous with no one of these. Satire is primarily dependent on the motive of its writer. Unless meant for satire, it is not the real thing; unconscious satire is a contradiction of terms, or a mere figure of speech. Secondarily, satire depends on the reader. What seems to us satire to-day, may not seem so tomorrow. Or, what seems satire to a pessimistic mind, may seem merely good-natured chaff to an optimist. This, of course, refers to the subtler forms of satire. Many classic satires are direct lampoons or broadsides which admit of only one interpretation. Literature numbers many satirists among its most honoured names; and the best satires show intellect, education, and a keen appreciation of human nature. Nor is satire necessarily vindictive or spiteful. Often its best examples show a kindly tolerance for the vice or folly in question, and even hint a tacit acceptance of the conditions condemned. Again, in the hands of a carping and unsympathetic critic, satire is used with vitriolic effects on sins for which the writer has no mercy. This lashing form of satire was doubtless the earliest type. The Greeks show sardonic examples of it, but the Romans allowed a broader sense of humour to soften the satirical sting. Following and outstripping Lucilius, Horace is the acknowledged father of satire, and was himself followed, and, in the opinion of some, outstripped by Juvenal. But the works of the ancient satirists are of interest mainly to scholars, and cannot be included in a collection destined for a popular audience. The present volume, therefore, is largely made up from the products of more recent centuries. From the times of Horace and Juvenal, down through the mediaeval ages to the present day, satires may be divided into the two classes founded by the two great masters: the work of Horace''s followers marked by humour and tolerance, that of Juvenal''s imitators by bitter invective. On the one side, the years have arrayed such names as Chaucer, Swift, Goldsmith, and Thackeray; on the other, Langland, Dryden, Pope, and Burns. A scholarly gentleman of our own day classifies satires in three main divisions: those directed at society, those which ridicule political conditions, and those aimed at individual characters. These variations of the art of satire form a fascinating study, and to one interested in the subject, this small collection of representative satires can be merely a series of guide-posts. It is the compiler''s regret that a great mass of material is necessarily omitted for lack of space; other selections are discarded because of their present untimeliness, which deprives them of their intrinsic interest. But an endeavour has been made to represent the greatest and best satiric writers, and also to include at least extracts from the masterpieces of satire. It is often asked why we have no satire at the present day. Many answers have been given, but one reason is doubtless to be found in the acceleration of the pace of life; fads and foibles follow one another so quickly, that we have time neither to write nor read satiric disquisitions upon them. Another reason lies in the fact that we have achieved a broader and more tolerant human outlook. Again, the true satirist must he possessed of earnestness and sincerity. And it is a question whether the mental atmosphere of the twentieth century tends to stimulate and foster those qualities. These explanations, however, seem to apply to American writers more especially than to English. The leisurely thinking Briton, with his more personal viewpoint, has produced, and is even now producing, satires marked by strength....",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VC7uzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The figure of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the text is often read as an analogue for other female intellectuals, like Woolf herself, who suffered from illness, feigned or real, as a part of their status as female writers.

A Twist of Faith,John Donnelly,Religion,,,"American Christians, veteran reporter John Donnelly has discovered, are an ever-increasing source of aid in Africa, with some experts estimating that U.S. churches supply more resources to Africa than USAID. In A Twist of Faith, he tells the unlikely story of how faith and determination compelled one such American Christian to travel to Africa and open a school for children orphaned by the AIDS epidemic. David Nixon, a carpenter from North Carolina who had lived through his share of trouble, knew nothing about the small, land-locked African country of Malawi. But after having a religious awakening and hearing about a preacher's efforts to aid its impoverished and beleaguered citizens, he raises money from his church and sets off to do what so many well-intentioned Americans of faith do in Africa: build an orphanage. But as his plans are beset with difficulties, Nixon slowly comes to realize that helping others requires listening to and learning from them. And that means changing his preconceived ideas of what the Malawians need and how he can best serve them. A Twist of Faith is the story of one man who, despite personal struggles, a profound cultural gap, the corruption of local officials, and the heartbreak of losing an orphan he comes to love, saves himself by saving others in a place nothing like home. Nixon's story is representative of a growing trend: the thousands of American Christians who are impassioned donors of time, money, and personal energy, devoted to helping African children.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ib9vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Before his tragically early death, Boothby lived his life equally in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and in this novel he creates a narrative that moves breathtakingly from the West and East Ends of London to a thrilling climax in the South Seas via Egypt and Australia",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S0sAzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Ambivalent Detective in Victorian Sensation Novels,Sarah Yoon,Fiction,55.63 EUR,,"The Ambivalent Detective in Victorian Sensation Novels studies how the detective as a literary character evolved through the mid-nineteenth century in England, as seen in sensation novels. In contrast to most assumptions about the English detective, Yoon argues that the detective was more often tolerated than admired following the establishment of professional detectives in the London Metropolitan Police Force in 1842. Through studying the historical and literary contexts between the 1840s to the 1860s, Yoon argues that the detective was seen as a suspicious, even mistrusted and disdained, figure who was nonetheless viewed as necessary to combat rising levels of crime. The detective as a literary character responded to the often contradictory values and aspirations of the middle class, representing an independent masculinity and laying claim to scientific authority. This study surveys novels by Charles Dickens, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, and Wilkie Collins, alongside lesser-known writers like William Russell, James Redding Ware (pseudonym Andrew Forrester), and William Stephens Hayward. This book contributes to the study of mid-nineteenth-century Victorian culture and connects with broader studies of the detective fiction genre.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=My7yEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Science and Religion in Neo-Victorian Novels,John Glendening,Literary Criticism,41.72 EUR,,"Criticism about the neo-Victorian novel — a genre of historical fiction that re-imagines aspects of the Victorian world from present-day perspectives — has expanded rapidly in the last fifteen years but given little attention to the engagement between science and religion. Of great interest to Victorians, this subject often appears in neo-Victorian novels including those by such well-known authors as John Fowles, A. S. Byatt, Graham Swift, and Mathew Kneale. This book discusses novels in which nineteenth-century science, including geology, paleontology, and evolutionary theory, interacts with religion through accommodations, conflicts, and crises of faith. In general, these texts abandon conventional religion but retain the ethical connectedness and celebration of life associated with spirituality at its best. Registering the growth of nineteenth-century secularism and drawing on aspects of the romantic tradition and ecological thinking, they honor the natural world without imagining that it exists for humans or functions in reference to human values. In particular, they enact a form of wonderment: the capacity of the mind to make sense of, creatively adapt, and enjoy the world out of which it has evolved — in short, to endow it with meaning. Protagonists who come to experience reality in this expansive way release themselves from self-anxiety and alienation. In this book, Glendening shows how, by intermixing past and present, fact and fiction, neo-Victorian narratives, with a few instructive exceptions, manifest this pattern.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8WvDwKgcyQcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Victims of the Book,François Proulx,Literary Criticism,,,"Victims of the Book uncovers a long-neglected but once widespread subgenre: the fin-de-si?cle novel of formation in France. Novels about and geared toward adolescent male readers were imbued with a deep worry over young Frenchmen's masculinity, as evidenced by titles like Crise de jeunesse (Youth in Crisis, 1897), La Crise virile (Crisis of Virility, 1898), La Vie st?rile (A Sterile Life, 1892), and La Mortelle Impuissance (Deadly Impotence, 1903). In this book, Fran?ois Proulx examines a wide panorama of these novels, many of which have rarely been studied, as well as polemical essays, pedagogical articles, and medical treatises on the perceived threats posed by young Frenchmen's reading habits. Against this cultural backdrop, he illuminates all that was at stake in representations of the male reader by prominent novelists of the period, including Jules Vall?s, Paul Bourget, Maurice Barr?s, Andr? Gide, and Marcel Proust. In the final decades of the nineteenth century, social commentators insistently characterized excessive reading as an emasculating illness that afflicted French youth. Fin-de-si?cle writers responded to this pathologization of reading with a profusion of novels addressed to young male readers, paradoxically proposing their own novels as potential cures. In the early twentieth century, this corpus was critically revisited by a new generation of writers. Victims of the Book shows how Gide and Proust in particular reworked the fin-de-si?cle paradox to subvert cultural norms about literature and masculinity, proposing instead a queer pact between writer and reader.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U1G_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Baldwin: A Love Story,Nicholas Boggs,Biography & Autobiography,22.88 EUR,,"Drawing on new archival material, original research, and interviews, this spellbinding book is the first major biography of James Baldwin in three decades, revealing how profoundly his personal relationships shaped his life and work. Baldwin: A Love Story, the first major biography of James Baldwin in three decades, reveals how profoundly the writer’s personal relationships shaped his life and work. Drawing on newly uncovered archival material and original research and interviews, this spellbinding book tells the overlapping stories of Baldwin’s most sustaining intimate and artistic relationships: with his mentor, the Black American painter Beauford Delaney; with his lover and muse, the Swiss painter Lucien Happersberger; and with his collaborators, the famed Turkish actor Engin Cezzar and the iconoclastic French artist Yoran Cazac, whose long-overlooked significance as Baldwin’s last great love is explored in these pages for the first time. Nicholas Boggs shows how Baldwin drew on all the complex forces within these relationships—geographical, cultural, political, artistic, and erotic— and alchemized them into novels, essays, and plays that speak truth to power and had an indelible impact on the civil rights movement and on Black and queer literary history. Richly immersive, Baldwin: A Love Story follows the writer’s creative journey between Harlem, Paris, Switzerland, the southern United States, Istanbul, Africa, the South of France, and beyond. In so doing, it magnifies our understanding of the public and private lives of one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century, whose contributions only continue to grow in influence.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m68aEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction of electrolytic Capacitor using Artificial Intelligence,"Cherry Bhargava, Shivani Gulati",Computers,36.99 EUR,,"Master's Thesis from the year 2017 in the subject Computer Sciences - Artificial Intelligence, grade: 9.00, Lovely Professional University, Punjab (Lovely professional university, Punjab), course: M.Tech, language: English, abstract: Residual life prediction is the technique which demonstrates how reliable a particular electronic system or component works under in specific operating conditions. The remaining useful life relies on the failure rate of a component and on the operating conditions of a device. This failure rate drifts for the duration of the life of the item with time. Life is an important aspect while choosing the electronic hardware. Residual life estimation and life prediction are two distinct terms. The importance of life estimation is to evaluate the remaining useful life of a specific component under the different stress parameters. As an increasing number of components are integrated on to a chip, the chances of failure increase, as the different parts have their own stress factors and different working conditions. So the condition monitoring strategies are utilized which enhances the reliability of a component and a suitable move to be made before any harmful breakdown happens. The electronic circuits need a failure estimation technique to protect the system from unavoidable failures. Residual life estimation of electronic components is an important fact these days as electronic components and devices becomes a great need of society. Residual life prediction is predicting the remaining useful life of a component or device based on various failure factors of any component and it also depends on the operating conditions. Many methods for predicting the life of electronic components have been developed. The life of electronic components can be predicted by creating an intelligent system for the failure analysis. The capability to predict the life of electronic components is a key to prevent the sudden costly failure and it will increase the overall performance and reliability of a system. So, remaining useful life prediction is an important factor for every active and passive electronic component such as resistor, capacitor and diode etc.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p1tyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Birth of the English Common Law,R. C. van Caenegem,Law,,,"This book provides a challenging interpretation of the emergence of the common law in Anglo-Norman England, against the background of the general development of legal institutions in Europe. In a detailed discussion of the emergence of the central courts and the common law they administered, the author traces the rise of the writ system and the growth of the jury system in twelfth-century England. Professor van Caenegem attempts to explain why English law is so different from that on the Continent and why this divergence began in the twelfth century, arguing that chance and chronological accident played the major part and led to the paradox of a feudal law of continental origin becoming one of the most typical manifestations of English life and thought. First published in 1973, The Birth of the English Common Law has come to enjoy classical status, and in a preface Professor van Caenegem discusses some recent developments in the study of English law under the Norman and earliest Angevin kings.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RUqm4hN6OwkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Transatlantic Constitution,Mary Sarah Bilder,History,,,"Departing from traditional approaches to colonial legal history, Mary Sarah Bilder argues that American law and legal culture developed within the framework of an evolving, unwritten transatlantic constitution that lawyers, legislators, and litigants on both sides of the Atlantic understood. The central tenet of this constitution—that colonial laws and customs could not be repugnant to the laws of England but could diverge for local circumstances—shaped the legal development of the colonial world. Focusing on practices rather than doctrines, Bilder describes how the pragmatic and flexible conversation about this constitution shaped colonial law: the development of the legal profession; the place of English law in the colonies; the existence of equity courts and legislative equitable relief; property rights for women and inheritance laws; commercial law and currency reform; and laws governing religious establishment. Using as a case study the corporate colony of Rhode Island, which had the largest number of appeals of any mainland colony to the English Privy Council, she reconstructs a largely unknown world of pre-Constitutional legal culture.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PhOQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Archaeology of Anxiety,Galina Rylkova,History,,,"The ""Silver Age"" (c. 1890-1917) has been one of the most intensely studied topics in Russian literary studies, and for years scholars have been struggling with its precise definition. Firmly established in the Russian cultural psyche, it continues to influence both literature and mass media. The Archaeology of Anxiety is the first extended analysis of why the Silver Age occupies such prominence in Russian collective consciousness. Galina Rylkova examines the Silver Age as a cultural construct-the byproduct of an anxiety that permeated society in reaction to the social, political, and cultural upheavals brought on by the Bolshevik Revolution, the fall of the Romanovs, the Civil War, and Stalin's Great Terror. Rylkova's astute analysis of writings by Anna Akhmatova, Vladimir Nabokov, Boris Pasternak and Victor Erofeev reveals how the construct of the Silver Age was perpetuated and ingrained. Rylkova explores not only the Silver Age's importance to Russia's cultural identity but also the sustainability of this phenomenon. In so doing, she positions the Silver Age as an essential element to Russian cultural survival.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dyZ4j7H-NPoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Death embodied,"Zoë L. Devlin, Emma-Jayne Graham",Social Science,25.68 EUR,,"In April 1485, a marble sarcophagus was found on the outskirts of Rome. It contained the remains of a young Roman woman so well-preserved that she appeared to have only just died and the sarcophagus was placed on public view, attracting great crowds. Such a find reminds us of the power of the dead body to evoke in the minds of living people, be they contemporary (survivors or mourners) or distanced from the remains by time, a range of emotions and physical responses, ranging from fascination to fear, and from curiosity to disgust. Archaeological interpretations of burial remains can often suggest that the skeletons which we uncover, and therefore usually associate with past funerary practices, were what was actually deposited in graves, rather than articulated corpses. The choices made by past communities or individuals about how to cope with a dead body in all of its dynamic and constituent forms, and whether there was reason to treat it in a manner that singled it out (positively or negatively) as different from other human corpses, provide the stimulus for this volume. The nine papers provide a series of theoretically informed, but not constrained, case studies which focus predominantly on the corporeal body in death. The aims are to take account of the active presence of dynamic material bodies at the heart of funerary events and to explore the questions that might be asked about their treatment; to explore ways of putting fleshed bodies back into our discussions of burials and mortuary treatment, as well as interpreting the meaning of these activities in relation to the bodies of both deceased and survivors; and to combine the insights that body-centered analysis can produce to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of the body, living and dead, in past cultures.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1QBDCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Giants in the earth,O. E. Rølvaag,Fiction,1.99 EUR,,"In 'Giants in the Earth,' O. E. Rølvaag masterfully explores the struggles and triumphs of Norwegian immigrants in the American Midwest during the late 19th century. Through vivid imagery and rich, lyrical prose, Rølvaag delves into the lives of his characters as they wrestle with the harsh realities of frontier life, the clash of cultures, and the haunting pull of their ancestral roots. Written in a naturalistic style, the narrative immerses readers in the psychological torment and resilience of the settlers, offering a poignant reflection on identity and belonging in a rapidly changing world. O. E. Rølvaag, a Norwegian-American novelist and a significant figure in immigrant literature, draws upon his own experiences as an immigrant to inform his work. Arriving in the United States as a young man, he personally grappled with cultural dislocation, which profoundly shaped his perspective and narrative voice. Rølvaag's deep understanding of the immigrant experience allows him to authentically portray the emotional complexities faced by his characters, making their struggles resonate on a universal level. Recommended for readers interested in the themes of migration, identity, and cultural conflict, 'Giants in the Earth' serves as both a historical account and a timeless exploration of the human spirit. Rølvaag's nuanced portrayal of resilience in the face of adversity will captivate those who appreciate rich storytelling and the exploration of cultural heritage.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YAVdEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
The Mustangs,James Frank Dobie,History,,,"J. Frank Dobie, master storyteller of the American Southwest, here tells the tale of the wild and free mustangs that once roamed the western ranges. This is the story, too, of the white men and the Indians, no less wild and free, who captured them, gentled them, rode them, and annihilated them. An American classic, The Mustangs is a thoughtful and carefully crafted book by one of this country's literary greats. ""This is a magnificent book, so packed with lore and legend that one is not conscious of the fact that it is history, too. Frank Dobie tells the story of the mustangs . . . the story too of the men, and the way of life the mustang brought into being."" --New York Herald Tribune ""Mr. Dobie brings together all his findings in a single book of solid scholarship, documented to the hilt, and inspired by his unflagging enthusiasm for the wild free creatures of the West. The Mustangs will probably remain the standard work on the subject."" --New York Times ""Not alone from stodgy tomes and rare pamphlets of cloistered libraries of a continent, but from widely scattered remudas and firsthand experiences of salty wranglers, have come the color, flavor and vitality to this beautiful book."" --Dallas Times Herald",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=02RMPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
Not the Slightest Chance,Tony Banham,History,,,"More than 10% of Hong Kong's defenders were killed in battle; a further 20% died in captivity. Those who survived seldom spoke of their experiences. Many died young. The little primary material surviving--written in POW camps or years after the events--is contradictory and muddled. Yet with just 14,000 defending the colony, it was possible to write from the individual's point of view rather than that of the Big Battalions so favoured by God (according to Napoleon) and most historians. The book assembles a phase-by-phase, day-by-day, hour-by-hour, and death-by-death account of the battle.

The Festival of Insignificance,Milan Kundera,Fiction,8.89 EUR,,"“Slender but weighty. . . . What is moving about this novel is its embrace of what has always driven Kundera, the delicate state of living between being and nothingness.”— Boston Globe From the internationally acclaimed, bestselling author of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, an entertaining and enchanting novel—""a fitting capstone on an extraordinary career."" (Slate) Casting light on the most serious of problems and at the same time saying not one serious sentence; being fascinated by the reality of the contemporary world and at the same time completely avoiding realism—that’s The Festival of Insignificance. Readers who know Milan Kundera’s earlier books know that the wish to incorporate an element of the “unserious” in a novel is not at all unexpected of him. In Immortality, Goethe and Hemingway stroll through several chapters together talking and laughing. And in Slowness, Vera, the author’s wife, says to her husband: “you’ve often told me you meant to write a book one day that would have not a single serious word in it…I warn you: watch out. Your enemies are lying in wait.” Kundera is finally and fully realizing his old aesthetic dream in this novel that we could easily view as a summation of his whole work. A strange sort of summation. Strange sort of epilogue. Strange sort of laughter, inspired by our time, which is comical because it has lost all sense of humor. What more can we say? Nothing.

The Physics of Submicron Structures,Harold L. Grubin,Science,53.49 EUR,,"Research on electronic transport in ultra small dimensions has been highly stimulated by the sensational developments in silicon technology and very large scale integration. The papers in this volume, however, have been influenced to no lesser extent by the advent of molecular beam epitaxy and metal/organic chemical vapor deposition which has made possible the control of semiconductor boundaries on a quantum level. This new control of boundary condi tions in ultra small electronic research is the mathematical reason for a whole set of innovative ideas. For the first time in the history of semiconductors, it is possible to design device functions from physical considerations involving ~ngstom scale dimensions. At the time the meeting was held, July 1982, it was one of the first strong signals of the powerful developments in this area. During the meeting, important questions have been answered concerning ballistic transport, Monte Carlo simulations of high field transport and other developments pertinent to new device concepts and the understanding of small devices from physics to function. The committee members want to express their deep appreciation to the speakers who have made the meeting a success.

The Shuttle,Frances Hodgson Burnett,,,,"No man knew when the Shuttle began its slow and heavy weaving from shore to shore, that it washeld and guided by the great hand of Fate. Fate alone saw the meaning of the web it wove, the mightof it, and its place in the making of a world's history. Men thought but little of either web orweaving, calling them by other names and lighter ones, for the time unconscious of the strength ofthe thread thrown across thousands of miles of leaping, heaving, grey or blue ocean.Fate and Life planned the weaving, and it seemed mere circumstance which guided the Shuttle toand fro between two worlds divided by a gulf broader and deeper than the thousands of miles ofsalt, fierce sea-the gulf of a bitter quarrel deepened by hatred and the shedding of brothers' blood.Between the two worlds of East and West there was no will to draw nearer. Each held apart. Thosewho had rebelled against that which their souls called tyranny, having struggled madly and shedblood in tearing themselves free, turned stern backs upon their unconquered enemies, broke allcords that bound them to the past, flinging off ties of name, kinship and rank, beginning with fiercedisdain a new life.Those who, being rebelled against, found the rebels too passionate in their determination and toodesperate in their defence of their strongholds to be less than unconquerable, sailed back haughtilyto the world which seemed so far the greater power. Plunging into new battles, they added newconquests and splendour to their land, looking back with something of contempt to the half-savageWest left to build its own civilisation without other aid than the strength of its own strong righthand and strong uncultured brain.But while the two worlds held apart, the Shuttle, weaving slowly in the great hand of Fate, drewthem closer and held them firm, each of them all unknowing for many a year, that what had at firstbeen mere threads of gossamer, was forming a web whose strength in time none could compute, whose severance could be accomplished but by tragedy and convulsion",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RxpCzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The House Of The Vampire,George Sylvester Viereck,Fiction,,,"The freakish little leader of the orchestra, newly imported from Sicily to New York, tossed his conductor's wand excitedly through the air, drowning with musical thunders the hum of conversation and the clatter of plates. Yet neither his apish demeanour nor the deafening noises that responded to every movement of his agile body detracted attention from the figure of Reginald Clarke and the young man at his side as they smilingly wound their way to the exit. The boy's expression was pleasant, with an inkling of wistfulness, while the soft glimmer of his lucid eyes betrayed the poet and the dreamer. The smile of Reginald Clarke was the smile of a conqueror. A suspicion of silver in his crown of dark hair only added dignity to his bearing, while the infinitely ramified lines above the heavy-set mouth spoke at once of subtlety and of strength. Without stretch of the imagination one might have likened him to a Roman cardinal of the days of the Borgias, who had miraculously stepped forth from the time-stained canvas and slipped into twentieth century evening-clothes....",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bNPhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The difference is exemplified by the difference between Marx and Rousseau: the latter sentimental and soft, appealing to emotion, obliterating sharp outlines; the former systematic like Hegel, full of hard intellectual content, appealing to historic necessity and the technical development of industry, suggesting a view of human beings as puppets in the grip of omnipotent material forces.

The Frankenstein Film Sourcebook,"Caroline Picart, Frank Smoot, Jayne Blodgett",Performing Arts,75.22 EUR,,"The endurance of the Frankenstein narrative as a modern cinematic myth is undeniable. Its flexibility has produced classic and contemporary horror film-most notably the Universal films of the thirties-but it has also resulted in unusual hybrids, such as musical horror-comedy (The Rocky Horror Picture Show), hyperbolic parody (Flesh for Frankenstein), and science fiction (the Alien and Terminator series). This sourcebook provides a complete guide to all of the story's filmic incarnations-including essential information such as cast, creative personnel, and plot summaries-and also guides the reader to relevant primary texts such as scripts, posters, production histories, and newspaper clippings. Utilizing an approach that is both popular and scholarly, and including spotlight essays that deal with contemporary academic approaches to the subject, The Frankenstein Film Sourcebook reveals the depth of the cinematic range of interpretations of a classic modern myth. Comprehensive in its scope, The Frankenstein Film Sourcebook provides an alphabetical guide to two hundred films that incorporate the Frankenstein narrative.

Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1900 edition. Excerpt: ... IX. Evolution Broken at the Neck. Mr. Darwin invented the theory of a continuous force which, beginning at a protoplasm, develops into every form of life, of consciousness, or of conscience. This involves all organic and all inorganic substance. The simplicity of this theory was thought to solve all problems of existence. It was eagerly accepted, illustrated, and set forth as the end of all controversy in respect of the creational mind and methods. It satisfied all who were willing to reduce everything to natural law with its cast-iron necessity. It relieved humanity thereby from all responsibility. It presented to the insatiable conscience a theory of human life and condition which must still its clamors and endless protests once and forever. This mighty chain of created fate consisted of many adamantine links, which defled all interruption. As usual, the whole world seemed for a time captivated and carried away with this marvelous solution of moral law and of all spiritual life; it set free the slave of mortal fear; it released man from the hot shackles of Sinai; it enthroned nature in all her moods of terror and beauty as the one mistress of the world; it drove back the tyranny of inspiration into the dim regions of star-dust, and offered an undisturbed sleep to all the sons and daughters of humanity in nature's ceaselessly recurring seasons of death and life; it transformed all immortality into a dream of the past. Mr. Darwin was himself transformed by his own philosophy from a Christian to a materialist. His letter to a student at Jena, published in the Pall Mall Gazette, dated Down, June 5, 1879, shows the change: Sir: I'm very busy, and am an old man in delicate health, and have not time to answer your questions fully, even...",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_oOIngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
